u/suyashdevgupta,Coffee Review: Beanly's Pour-Over and Dip Bags,3,2020-05-29 09:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/gsls48/coffee_review_beanlys_pourover_and_dip_bags/,"[Beanly Coffee Co](https://beanlycoffee.com/). doesn’t sell whole bean coffee. What they sell is speciality coffee that can be brewed without any equipment. A position in the Indian coffee industry similar to [Sleepy Owl](https://sleepyowl.co/). This movement of offering easy-to-brew coffee is being called the 4th wave of coffee. 

In their store, they have the single-serve pour-over bags and tea bag style dip bags. Both of these come in two blends, their master blend and the slightly higher priced organic blend. Along with all this, they also sell a ‘Sweetened Creamer’, which is condensed milk and sugar. 

## First Impressions and Details 

The package I received contained all their products. The box and packaging were impressive. Not that it matters. But still, it's a plus.

As of now, both their Dip Bags and Pour-Overs come only in blends. And, both are medium roasts with the same intensity label. That is 3 on a scale of 1-5.

The pour-overs are 9 grams each. The packet says they brew 180-220 ml. The Dip coffee bags are 14 grams each and brew 200-230 ml.

The packets are nitro flush-wrapped. This helps in keeping the coffee fresh. 

For freshly roasted speciality coffee they have a rather long shelf life. I don’t know the roasting date of the batch of the one I received (it wasn’t mentioned), but the best-by date is almost 6 months away. 

## Brewing

### Pour-Over

I brewed both of them in a ratio of 1:17 (1 gram coffee for every 17 grams of water). This gave me a total of 155 grams. The brewing was pretty quick. Total brew time was around 1 minute and 47 seconds. 

Now, measuring the water gram to gram, sticking to the ratio and being so precise wasn’t isn’t necessary at all. This, in fact, defeats the purpose of such a product (something I’ll talk about in the latter part of this review). The only reason I did it was for the sake of taste assessment. For racking it against other coffees, in terms of taste.

### Dip Bags

Here I brewed using the [French Press](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B01GUXR8VO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=suyashdevgupt-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;creative=24630&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01GUXR8VO&amp;linkId=ea9fd328ec5c97919134bde8300a6b89) ratio of 1:15. I will talk about the French Press bit in a bit. This ratio gave me a total of 210 grams. The immersion time was 4 minutes, just like the French Press. 

Again, being this precise isn’t as necessary. Eyeballing and guessing the amount of water and brew time should give you good-enough results.

## Taste Test and Results

### Pour-Over

The taste was surprisingly good for pre-packed and pre-ground coffee. The packets said that both the blends were medium roasts and the intensity was the same, 3 out of 5. But clearly, the organic blend was more intense. In fact, it seemed to me that they were dark roasted coffees. They lacked the slight fruitiness and acidity of medium roasts.

📷📷

I liked the master blend more. It was more pleasant to drink. The taste was very balanced and traditional. Something the Indian market would highly appreciate. The creamer partnered with the coffee profile very well. I even made my family taste it, who clearly preferred it with the creamer. 

The caveat though, is that the coffee didn’t extract evenly throughout. This is because of the design of these pour-over bags. There was definitely channelling and dry spots. Now, this problem is not unique to Beanly. It persists with the whole industry since everybody uses this same design. The bottom flaps were the key problem areas.

To minimize the effect of this problem, blooming should be a must. Although, I am not sure if even that will counter the whole of it.

Also, I couldn’t help but notice that the coffee seemed too fine in grind size. Almost Moka Pot fineness. This could have been the reason for the little notes of bitterness. Maybe, they had dialled in the coffee according to the profile. The team would know better.

One more thing, you also have the option of leaving the bag as it is, after pouring, for some time as it steeps. This would happen more and more in shorter mugs. I don’t really see leaving the bags in, an option for myself. You can give it a try. It would result in a more bitter or bold cup.

### Dip Bags

This was the first time I tried the dip bags. And, I found them better in taste out of the two. But, this is only my personal preference. 

Where you might get away with pouring a little too much water with the pour-over. Here, the chances of making your cup watery are much much higher. This is because the steeping time is not so adjustable. Steeping longer would only result in more bitterness. 

Since convenience is what you would want with a product like this, it clearly wins over the pour-overs. 

What I particularly liked was the taste of am immersion brew, with almost no sediment. Basically, French Press without the sediment. Some people will scoff at this since the sediment and the earthy-ness makes the French Press so unique. But I’m not that big of a fan. I prefer a much cleaner cup. 

Just like the pour-over, the coffee seemed ground too fine for French Press standards. 

### Creamer

The creamer was quite sweet. The texture was very rich. It tasted a lot like condensed milk but diluted. The edge it will have over milk is that it doesn’t add volume to the coffee. Moreover, it makes it thicker than adding milk. 

I think, the quantity seemed too much for a single serving. But this wouldn’t be the case while making a latte or some other drink. 

## Final Thoughts and Conclusion

### Pricing

📷📷

Let’s talk about pricing. The master blend pour-over 10 pack is priced at Rs. 350. And, the organic blend pour-over 10 pack at Rs 400. This makes them Rs 35 and Rs 40 per bag respectively. The master blend dip bag 10 pack is for Rs 310 and the organic blend is for Rs.350. This makes each dip bag Rs 31 and Rs 35 respectively.

Now, I’m sure with some coupon code and discount you can get it for a lesser amount. 

At these prices, I think, a cup of fairly good coffee is quite affordable and worth the money.

### Who and What Is It For 

This is one of the most important questions that need to be addressed. 

Clearly, this is not for everyone, neither should it be. 

First, I think it would be fairly good as a starting point for anyone who would want to brew speciality coffee. The low cost and effort would allow you to experiment. 

Second, it is great for travelling, or wherever I can’t bring my equipment. Someone could argue that an [AeroPress ](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=suyashdevgupt-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;creative=24630&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&amp;linkId=4948f33ec42356e320874068b29978c7)has much more versatility and makes great-tasting coffee. But these take even less effort than an AeroPress. 

I personally would carry a couple of these in my bag. 

One last thing, the idea that products like these can replace the experience of brewing a real pour-over or french press, is completely out of the picture. Neither is that the purpose of such products, nor are they at par.

Coming to gurgaon for work was a major turning point in accessibility. So, I started with deciding the equipment and started out with sampling all Blue Tokai's offerings and tried the roasting and cupping class. I always consume a lot of podcasts so I naturally listened to many ( a bit too many ) coffee related podcasts as well. Then chancing upon sixteen grams coffee was a good milestone. Got to branch out and sample coffee from many roasters that I wasn't able to find on my own. The small scale roasters really don't have much exposure, but then I also am cut off from most social media. So, I've tried from Curious life, some international roasters, Koinonia, Kaffa cerrado, QBF (maverick ?),  Beanrove, Savorworks and El bueno.
Thus far, at least one thing for me I've concluded that I mostly prefer light to medium roasts. But then, roast levels are not standard among roasters, only sampling helps in determining what one would like.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/hgzue3/comment_your_journey_and_motivations_in/

And that's to be expected, since cloth doesn't offer as much resistance as paper does. I had to go a lot finer than usual on grind size to get a proper drawdown time. 

The sampler pack came with three different filters: Unos, Dos &amp; Tres. Unos, the thickest among the lot, was my favorite as it was easier to work with. I had some trouble dialling in my coffee with Dos, as it ran much faster than Unos. I haven't really used the Tres filters, but I imagine it'll be good for brewing coffees that extract easily (Darker roasts).

After I had finally dialled in my coffee for the filters, I noticed that getting a flat bed was much easier with these filters. I suppose that's because the fines don't get stuck to the filter like they do with paper. Thus, getting an even extraction is easier with these filters.

My V60 technique is nowhere near as perfect as some of the members of this subreddit. I don't have a gooseneck kettle or a thermometer. So I falter a bit when it comes to the reproducibility of my brews. But after I had gotten a good understanding of the grind size, majority of my brews were on the better side of the spectrum. There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to the understanding of the grind size though. My few initial brews were horribly underextracted, with drawdown times of less than a minute. 

The resulting brews from the cloth filters appear somewhat 'muddier' than usual. It also has a lot more body than your usual filter coffee. James Hoffman described cloth filtered coffee as 'velvety' and 'buttery'. And I agree with him. It sure feels much smoother to drink. And the augmented body of the coffee has a good mouthfeel. But I found that the acidity of the coffee isn't expressed properly. I brewed two different coffees by two different roasters, and both of them were lacking on the promised citrusy notes. 

Before I got these filters, I thought cleaning them would be a major chore. And sure enough, it's more work than tossing a used paper filter into trash. But cleaning them is fairly straightforward. I threw the coffee grounds in the trash, and then hand washed the filter in the sink. After that, I hang them up to dry. The manual tells you to keep them in a water filled glass in the fridge, but I found hanging them to dry was much easier. 

After about using them for a week (14-15 brews) the filter started smelling a bit like stale coffee. And the smell was getting into my brews as well. But it went away after I boiled them for about 10-15 minutes in water. I don't think that'll be a problem for you if you wash them properly after your brews. 

Overall, I really enjoyed using them for a change. The coffee produced is a nice middle ground between Fillter coffee and French press coffee. They are not going to completely replace paper filters for me, but they are still pretty fun to brew with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/jnyi2h/ive_been_using_the_cloth_filters_from_wobh_for/

About two years back, I started taking black coffee mainly before I work out. I gradually got used to it and started taking coffee regularly. 

About a month back, I decided to switch from shop bought ground coffee powder to coffee beans from roasters. Since I was not sure which one I will like, I bought 2/3 different roats and am currently experimenting. My brewing method is to  just boil water, turn off the heat, add the powder, stir and wait for a few minutes, after which I just pour into a mug using a normal strainer. It was a hit or miss initially and over time I am getting the hang of it by adjusting the brew time, grind size etc.

Now, whenever I read about coffee brewing I see the different brew techniques allowing to extract the flavour/fruitiness of coffee. So I am now wondering whether I should switch from my primitive methods and switch to a more sophisticated option like a French press or an aeropress? Am I really missing much? If so, which one should I go for?

I joined this forum last evening and it is lovely to see so many people share their knowledge about coffee! I have started brewing recently - I have a V60 setup, a coffee scale, a gooseneck kettle, a moka pot, a French press and of course, a South Indian coffee filter and a bunch of pre-ground starter packs from a few roasters.

It appears from what I have read, a grinder is probably the biggest difference between a cup of coffee and a good cup of coffee, ceteris paribus. I have read through the many pros and cons of a manual vs. electric grinders. 

Some caveats:

\- I can't seem find any good quality manual grinders

\- I am unlikely to go down the espresso route

Any distinct advantage to spend the extra cash on Virtuoso+? I spoke to a coffee roaster and based on the description of my brew methods, they suggested I should get the Encore, until I told them about the SI coffee (for my dad). At that point, they suggested I should invest in the Virtuoso+ instead (i'm assuming the fine grind SI coffees are likely to require). I am fine buying it, but wanted to hear some thoughts before I actually made the purchase.

Also, I keep hearing about vacuum seal / airtight boxes to store beans. Would you have any recommendations for that, so I can get it when I purchase a grinder?

Thank you in advance.

But it's been a week since I've laid my hands on the Subko Lot 42 beans and I'm yet to taste any of the flavors mentioned on the packaging. (bubblegum being the biggest draw for me). 

I brew with a Size 1 V60. And following the recipe on Project22. ( [Ratnagiri Estate (Lot #42) by Subko Specialty Coffee Roasters (project22coffee.com)](https://www.project22coffee.com/post/ratnagiri-estate-lot-42-by-subko-specialty-coffee-roasters-94-points) 

**Grind size** (On the Timemore C2, 16 clicks is slightly bitter, 20 clicks was thin and weak, 18 was balanced) 

**Water temperature** (4 mins off boil as I don't have a thermometer, they mention 87 C) 

So I guess my question is while I did find the grind size that gave me a coffee that I liked in terms of balance, I was disappointed that I could not taste the flavor notes (I can definitely smell the bubblegum though, just not taste). Maybe it's worth mentioning that the **beans were roasted on 23-Nov** but Nischay did say that the flavors carried onto the fourth week as well. 

Could it be just down to my inexperience in brewing a pourover perfectly? I haven't tried this on the French Press, and will update here if I find that to be a better brew. 

If anyone has successfully extracted the flavors with this coffee, please let me know what I can try for next time.

I'm a coffee noob, and till now have been using a moka pot and a basic drip machine. I LOVE my moka pot coffee. Thick, strong with punchy flavours. I drink it like espresso. 

Trying to appreciate coffee more, I was just about to invest in a Hario mini mill but then discovered the Timemore C2. You think it's worth shelling the extra 1k for?

Secondly, I was considering buying a french press. From what I've understood till now moka pot coffee is a stronger version of the French press. So will brewing in a French press will be a totally different experience from just diluting the moka pot coffee with some water?

I recently got my hands on the hario v60 starter kit and I've been super excited to try it out, however I may have overlooked some of the other important equipment I needed to use it. 
My first 2 cups have come out almost inedible as I used a generic scale which I had lying around the house which rounds up to the closest gram.
That being said I'm debating buying the timemore black mirror basic from beandeck or the hario scale from Amazon. They seem to be in a similar price range and I can't find any notable difference between them. 
I'm hoping to receive reliable input from people who may be using any of the above to help me make a better decision. 
PS : I'm buying pre-ground coffee for now but hope to pick up a manual grinder sometime soon. The price range on some of these are extremely intimidating and I have no intention on spending that kind of money. Incase you guys have any suggestions on grinders which are decently priced and would produce good coffee for a moka pot and v60 please leave some suggestions for that too.
Thank you in advance.

UPDATE 

All you lads have been amazing! 
To summarize - 
1. Came here for advice on a scale but walking away with a Timemore C2 from the highly recommended u/vanshanand 
2. Ordered a basic scale for 500 bucks off Amazon to solve my scale issue 
3. Received delivery of my instacuppa gooseneck last week and infact used it for the above mentioned inedible cups, I'm yet iffy about the accuracy of the thermometer on the instacuppa kettle. However it may have something to do with my method so I'm just going to keep working on that. 
4. I tried the James Hoffman method but it just didn't workout, 30gms coffee to 500gms water but it took almost 5 minutes for the entire thing drawdown while he suggested it should be done in 3:30 minutes. Incase you have any suggestions on an ideal technique to follow i would appreciate that as well. 
5. Now that my setup is nearly complete I'd love your recommendations of must try beans for the v60.

The bags are nothing compared to the fresh roasted loose grounds, even if they get a month or so old (doesn’t really matter much with cold brew imo) 

I ordered a 5 pack of the light blend brew bags. First up the delivery was pretty late, took around 6 days. Agreed, that’s not in their hands and given the current situation, it’s not at all their fault.

The pack I received was ‘manufactured on’ 11th November 2020, which likely means the beans were roasted even prior to that. I get that this is a mass manufactured product unlike their single origin coffees, but I expected at least something that was not older than a month or so. 

The bag says it was packed by Beanly, a company whose products have consistently been bad in my opinion. Anyway I assumed the coffee inside was from Blue Tokai. The smell from the bag was... harsh and burnt and rubbery for the most part. I don’t know if it was because of the age of the coffee or the paper bag that it was in. I brewed one with the recommended instructions anyway. 

It tasted so unpleasantly sour. Like way too sour, not even a good fruity sourness. Maybe it was because they recommended brewing it in the fridge and not in at normal room temp, like I normally do for cold brews.

I just bought an aeropress and generally like my coffee with milk but I do want to experiment a little. 

I just made my first cup using 18Gm of the ""Jumping Ant"" from Black Baza Coffee (medium fine, light roast) with 60ml water, 2 minute of infusion, then added some milk(which I think was the mistake I made) the coffee tasted a little on the lighter side and kinda watery (I think I should've used the French press to foam the milk a little), I'd try to make a cup of Americano tonight and probably edit the post. Nothing wrong with the coffee, I am pretty sure it goes great without milk.

Now what I am looking for, something that goes good with Aeropress and then milk, (I love the cups of cappuccino I have at the little cafes around the city), should be a little bitter (atleast from what I just had, but not overwhelmingly bitter) and have stronger multiple flavour other than coffee, (I read people describing nutty and fruity flavours, I swear you guys make me feel like I have a less sensitive tongue, I don't catch the tiny notes of flavour). I would like the suggestions to be on the cheaper side of the budget.

I also tried a French press, but used it only a few times (a dark roast of a strong coffee, the smell would be so strong it would make me feel nauseated) and again being the fucking noob I am, I realised french press coffee doesn't go well with milk lmao (this happened a year ago, I am a little wiser now).

I am looking for ideas to improve my coffee journaling. I'm hoping to see what your brewing journal looks like?

* If you use a notebook, please share photos of the recent journal sheet.
* If you use an app, please mention the name of the app and share a screenshot of the recent brew page. 

Please feel free to share any other experience about how you reached this stage in your journaling experience, what matters the most to you in your journaling sheet, what's missing from your journaling sheet that you'd like to include in the future, or anything else that one should look for while deciding their journaling method?  
I use a note in iCloud with a table in it. This is what it looks like:

I've also tried a few apps, but I could never find the one that sufficed my requirements, so I resorted to keeping the note in iCloud.

Once I try something new and if I like it, I try other coffees with similar tasting notes. But there is no single comprehensive list of different roasters and coffees (apart from project22coffee).

Can the experts in this community come together and develop a flavour map for easily accessible coffees available in India? [Whiskey flavour map](https://www.scotchmaltwhisky.co.uk/images/whiskyflavourmap.jpg) is the closest reference I could find as Google didn't return one for coffees.

I'm new here and I just switched to filter coffee for some time now. I bought the Seven beans filter coffee with 80-20 mixture (dark roast) and I used french press for making coffee. Previously I used to have standard Bru or Nescafe instants. These days, the filter coffee I make don't really affect me much, it isn't as strong, it does not energize me as much as I still feel sleepy after taking a cup of it, compared to instant coffee where just one tablespoon could energize me for a day.

I have been using 2-3 tablespoons of filter coffee for making coffee. Should I put more than this to make a stronger coffee? Or are my tastebuds fucked? If anyone can help me out on this it would be nice.

I've also reviewed this communities suggestions to other users which include the Lelit Anna and Gaggia Classic Pro.

I have been brewing my own coffee since the last 6-7 years by sourcing freshly roasted coffee beans from various roasters all over India. I buy fresh roasted beans and then grind them at home and brew using various manual methods depending on the beans and what I feel like at that point in time. 

I have bought some fantastic coffees from Ethiopia, Costa Rica and other countries during my travels in the last few years. All of them have been bought from small batch roasters in US/Europe and have been amazing. However my search for finding non Indian origin fresh roasted beans in India have not yielded any results. Barring a couple of roasters selling these at astronomical prices there’s not much to be had. My last imported coffee was a beautiful Honduran coffee roasted in Japan which I ordered direct from the roaster there. However the import costs and time adds up and is not the most sustainable way going forward. 

Any pointers on where I could possibly buy from in India? Are there others who see this void in the Indian market also?

Sure you can wait or ask for coffee roasted 5 days ago but shouldnt it be standard and the consumer be educated.

2. Bean Gradation - I have recieved coffee from giants like Blue Tokai where there was no consistency of Beans which ranged from Peaberries to Supremo sizes and there were huge variations in between. Selling speciality coffee is one thing but not taking care of the small things doesnt pronounce speciality to me.

3. Taste Notes - There can never be standard taste notes for coffee or anything else especially when it relies on have a clear palette knowledge and discerning a taste from grape to apple is clearly not for everyone and so the same shouldnt even be printed. Rather if it is a necessacity, standard dicernable flavours like earthy, fruity, citrusy should be used denote so that any person who is starting his coffee journey gets it.

I recently left my job and will be starting my MBA (in the US) in August. I love coffee and have casually explored/learnt more about it over the past 3-4 years. 

Given the free time i have, I am considering reaching out to some coffee farms where I could learn and work for a month without any money exchanging hands. 

What I'm hoping to learn:
1. Everything about growing and brewing coffee, and a bit about coffee tasting. 
2. Some knowledge of the business side of the industry. 

How I can contribute:
1. Working on the farms/roasting centers (not sure if there is much work in this season). I've worked at oil rigs for 2+years, so I definitely down to get my hands dirty. 
2. Helping in any way needed behind the computer.


Would love to hear any leads/suggestions/ideas. Here is a bit about about me, if that's useful:

I'm a 2017 engineering graduate from one of the IITs, and have spent the last three and a half years working in the oil industry. The first 2 years were spent mostly on the ground/on oil rigs. For the past 1.5 years, I've been managing operations across parts of Africa and the middle East. I'll be matriculation as an MBA student at a top US university in August 2021 

I'm a big coffee fan, got into brewing a couple of years ago, and now want to take my knowledge and understanding to the next level

Thanks!

I recently started to drink specialty coffee like BlueTokai and enjoy it. However I’ve been using a Morphy Richards steam machine and the coffee can many a time be inconsistent and underwhelming. My family were set on buying a nespresso machine but reading this sub I get the feeling that’s not a good idea. I’ve been looking around and would be grateful for your suggestions. My options would be -

1. A delonghi Dedica - around 21.5k on Amazon 
2. A nespresso machine for round about 13k
3. A Gaggia Classic (but the 2015 model) for around 30k

These are my only options as I had to convince them to raise the budget. 

BTW I get my coffee ground by the cafe. In that case would I be better off with something like the Delonghi or would the Gaggia still be a better choice for 10k more(and the 2015 model). We also prefer milk drinks(I know I know I’m trying to get my palate used to without).

Firstly, I don't like acidity in coffees for the most part. Currently drinking the Sandalwood Estate by BT, I find it sharply acidic for my taste and the caramel flavour doesn't appeal much to me. I recently enjoyed their Dhak Blend a lot because of the sweetness of the coffee - really liked that. I really liked this coffee as it had the boldness of a dark roast with some other noticeable flavours.  Don't want to go all dark roast as I do enjoy some flavours. I've enjoyed some medium roasts with low acidity such as the Cafe Blend by BT. 

All in all, something towards the darker side of the roast with some sweet notes in it and/or medium roasts with low acidity. I hope I've been able to explain properly. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/necqo3/looking_for_coffee_recommendations/

First of all, thank you for existing. The feeling of finding an Indian coffee tribe for me can easily be described as having the first cup of freshly brewed coffee in the morning.

I've fairly recently migrated from the world of stale Nescafé and as the title suggests, it feels like a complete waste discarding the used coffee grounds. So, I was wondering if you people put it to a better use.


EDIT: So, it seems the top two options are either use it as a compost or include it in your skin care routine. Thank you everybody for responding! I'll definitely try these.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/ngtwlb/what_to_do_with_the_leftover_coffee_grounds_after/

1. Should I save my money and just upgrade the burr set of encore to virtuoso burr.  
2. Should I even buy 1z or instead get a sette 270 (later) as that is electric or the grind quality combined with the money saved is worth it for 1z.

I am planning to take a plunge in the home espresso hobby and deciding on the grinder between the Baratza Sette Grinder (270 preferred) and Eureka Mignon Grinder (Silenzio or Specialita). I plan to use any of these as a single-dose grinder paired with a Gaggia Classic Pro for \~2 espresso shots a day.

I have been doing a pro-cons list for this choice for a while and have summarized my understanding based on my priority list below. I would really appreciate any experience anyone has with these in a home or small cafe setting and can share/validate/challenge some of the assumptions or insights shared below.

1. **Quality and Consistency of Grind**: Largely similar but in my limited research flat burrs produce more consistent grind size. Hence, Eureka may have a slight advantage here.
2. **After Sales Support**: This is where Sette has a huge advantage as so many different companies carry this product in India and hence getting replacement parts is going to be easy. Blue Tokai even carries each part individually on their website, so I feel very confident that I will always be able to find replacement parts for it. Whereas the Eureka line of grinders is largely only carried by coffee plus.
3. **Long Term Durability**: I have seen so many comments and videos on YouTube showing that Sette is made of a lot of plastic parts inside and out and will wear out in 18-24 months' time and will need replacement parts. This is where I am unable to find similar long-term reviews of the Mignon line of grinders but they seem to be more sturdily built than the Sette. [Link1](https://youtu.be/_HR_zCtH7_0?t=118) [Link2 (See Comments)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQTF9AvYtBg&amp;ab_channel=Murphy%CC%81sCoffee)
4. **Grind Retention**: This is going to be critical as my setup will be a single dose grinding and I do not want to waste coffee when dialing in or changing beans for every shot. I really enjoy trying different coffees from different roasters and it's part of the fun of making coffee at home. Again, I think it's close in both but Sette beats out the Mignon here.
5. **Grind Adjustment Mechanism**: This is where Sette 270 really shines because you can remember the grind setting per bean and once you have dialed in you can focus on other variables of brewing or just repeat the recipe for continuous joy and enjoyment. I do not understand how will I log the grind setting for a bean after each run to dial in the coffee unless I do a few back-to-back espresso shots, which I doubt I will do.
6. **Grind Range**: Now, while my primary purpose is to buy an espresso focused grinder, it would be nice if the grinder can also do a v60 to Aeropress range well. I currently own a Timemore Chestnut C2, using which I get good results on a v60 and Aeropress. I do not make a lot of french press and hence not focused on a larger grind size range. Not planning to sell the hand grinder as it will be useful for the occasional french press/cold brew and terrific for travel.
7. **Noise/Speed**: Don't care. It's a minor annoyance for max 20s-30s.
8. **Timing Accuracy**: Don't care. I know the Sette 270 is really good at this, but since I'm planning to use it in a single dose by weight setup, it's not important at all.

Overall, I am leaning ever so slightly towards the Sette 270, but that's primarily driven by the after-sales support and a confidence that I will not be helpless if the grinder has a problem in 2 to 5 years to get the right replacement part and service. If there were multiple sellers of the Eureka Mignon grinders in India, I would have definitely gone for that.

I Will be happy to get everyone's thoughts, so thanks a lot everyone in advance and let the discussion begin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/odh905/baratza_sette_vs_eureka_mignon_for_home_espresso/

I have a few questions regarding this:
 
1. Is it normal that it needs descaling already? What could've possibly caused this? If it has to do with the hard water, I'd have to say the water at my place is kinda very hard but then, I do use water that's purified with the aquaguard machines.

2. Can I use any other third party descaler for the machine? Cuz when I google to buy some more descaling solution, there's an Amazon listing of a 500ml bottle for around  an exorbitant 3800 rupees. If yes, please link a good descaling solution below.

When i try to adjust the burr setting after grinding my beans, it gets stuck and doesn't allow me to turn the burr adjuster any finer.

Is this normal for everyone and is there a fix because currently, this is way too much of a hassle.

Edit; here's the video of me tryna show you my issue. In the beginning, im showing you its at zero point. Then i adjust it to my preferred grind size. I then act like im grinding some beans. Then when i try to move the adjuster one click finer. It's stuck and i can't. So i have to loosen the burr adjuster, use a knife to push the burr down (because the burr come up by itself due to the spring underneath, then move the adjuster to the zero point all over again.

I'm not the one usually to buy the book just by the title, but this one caught my eye and I instantly realized I have to get this one. It's a fiction that revolves around coffee!

I was skeptical of the book initially since a romance book, around coffee, written by a brand custodian of TATA group, sounded meh. I just thought it would look good on my shelf. 

One Saturday, just to get my mind off a hectic work week, I glanced upon this book while sipping coffee, and decided to give it a go. And man what a book. To be honest, the book is meh, story is a bit juvenile. There's ghost, there's romance, there's a crazy treasure hunt involving Japanese monks. Something even five years younger me wouldn't bother reading, but on the other side, the book had so much coffee sipping. Every few pages the , the protagonist would sit somewhere and sip coffee, and boy I'd rush to kitchen to make myself a cup of pour-over. The story starts in Mumbai, but the book takes the readers to Mangalore, Coimbatore, Coorg, Japan, and even Copenhagen(how crazy is that) and all these places are somehow linked to each other through coffee. There's even a coffee ghost(phew). 

I learned that although India is a tea-drinking nation, we have had a rich history of coffee since the colonial era. It has the story of monsooned Malabar coffee, and thanks to the book, I came across Bellada Kappi (man, jaggery with south Indian filter coffee is a bliss to the throat).  

This is something that I would gift someone who loves coffee. This one is for all the coffee-loving bookworms, a must-read if you haven't already!

Happy weekend.

I ordered the trial pack from Blue Tokai for starting, with the combination of Vienna Roast, Silver Oak and Monsoon Malabar. But I found their regular 250 gms. packs a bit costly for me to use as a daily driver. So I started looking for some relatively cheaper alternatives and found Bombay Island in the process. Usually, I drink two cups of coffee a day - some dark roasted beans in the morning and medium to lighter roasts in the evening. So I ordered 1 pack of Bynemara Estate and another of Mysore Nuggets. To be honest I kept my expectations low since most other roasters are charging 450 or higher for the equal quantity. And was I surprised. The moment I unpacked the coffee, I was struck by a strong, bold fragrance. Now I am not sure whether it's only about the blends that I have had from BT, but I didn't experience a smell this bold, not to imply their coffee was bad though. And the fact that Bombay Island costs me Rs. 80-100 lesser per pack makes it even more delightful xD. I have tasted both the coffee and think I liked them both. Not sure whether I should say Blue Tokai is overpriced, since I don't have much experience with specialty coffees at this point, but Bombay Island is offering a great value for money. So kudos to them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/oot9ck/bombay_island_appreciation_post/

What I do see is a way to brew coffee either overnight or in 20 minutes. But what is the difference between the south Indian coffee decoction and a clever dripper or a Vietnamese coffee dripper. From what I keep reading and listening about the coffee concoction is the thicker consistency of the coffee and the ratio of coffee and hickory root to make it such. 

I would really like to know what makes it a thicker consistency, compared to other brewing methods? Is it the hickory rather than just the coffee itself. Also can I achieve thicker consistency with other types of coffee without the hickory? 

If I were to brew regular coffee in the decoction method wont I get the same as a dripper?

I've recently acquired the clever coffee dripper and was hoping to avoid some of the initial trial and error. 
I've found multiple recipes with different grind sizes and have come to understand there is a vast window of grind sizes one can play around with for the Clever Dripper.
Can someone summarize the grind sizes that have worked for you on dark, medium and light roasts respectively. (If you could translate those on clicks for the Timemore C2 I'll be eternally grateful)
I'd also love to hear what recipes, tweaks and tricks work for you personally. 
Thanks in advance.

UPDATE 1-
About 20 cups later my findings are as follows. 
I've been using 6.5 grams coffee per 100ml water at 20 clicks on the C2 and this combination works well for almost all types of beans. 
The best cups brewed so far have been with Balur estate and Monsoon Malabar from Subko. Attikan estate from Blue tokai which usually brews well on most equipments is consistently delivering an underwhelming cup on the clever dripper.
I've also only exclusively been using the hoffman method as my draw down doesn't last more than 45 seconds and I almost always have a neat flat bed. The one time I messed up and put the coffee first my draw down took slightly above a minute.
Filter refills are a problem as the official clever dripper refills aren't available and you'll have to try which alternative filter from the mellita, moccamaster or local brands works best. The easily available filters are smaller and incase you're brewing large batches I.e 400ml-500ml you may face a problem. I still haven't gone down the rabbit hole of how different filters effect the quality of the brew but I have this weird hunch after brewing a cup or two  that the moccamaster filters aren't as good as the stock filters which come  with the clever dripper.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/orwbyt/clever_coffee_dripper_w_timemore_c2/

I'm new here and I'm sooo happy in found this thread! I am a FAN of Indian coffee. I'm originally from Canada where we get shitty Tim Horton's or Starbucks. Since I've been living in Delhi I've been a fan of BT. Normally order the Attikan estate from BT but I wanna try something new. I just saw the EPIPHANY blend from Naivo coffee. Has anyone tried it ? I love round, buttery, nutty coffees. Please suggest some roasters, I want to buy local ! 

Also, equipment wise, Ive been using a good french press but I read here that it's not good for milk coffee ! I normally add like 2 tbsp of milk. I decided then to buy new gear. Any suggestions ? AEROPRESS, V60... I don't like when there is tooo much to do thought... 

Last question: is it okay to grind your coffee beans in a spice blender? I've been doing that for a while but I'm wondering if I'm missing on the taste because of that. Since I use a FP corser grind if fine.

I recently posted photos of unroasted beans and some of you seemed to be interested in my home roasting process.

[Unroasted Beans](https://preview.redd.it/j3w8v8avtph71.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25266626a905e00b427a5c58041e72bc0f906dbe)

I have tried quite a few roasting processes like open skillet, oven, heat gun and a bowl. Skillet and oven do work but are incredibly inconsistent as there is no continuous agitation involved. Heat gun and bowl worked pretty good for me and I used this method for more than a year, the only issue was that this method had to be done outside as chaff gets flying everywhere.

So, I looked for new methods of roasting indoors without any special equipment and discovered a whirley pop roasting method. Whirley pop is a stovetop popcorn roaster which is basically a big pot with an attachment to agitate the corn for consistent heat throughout. And so I thought, How do we make popcorn at home? At least, in my household, popcorn is made in a pressure cooker and hence came up with the idea of roasting coffee in a pressure cooker. Yes, you read that correctly, a freaking **PRESSURE COOKER**.

For today's roast, I am roasting 150gm unroasted beans and my pressure cooker is a 2.5 litre one. First and foremost, we don't need any pressure buildup inside, so **REMOVE THE WHISTLE FIRST**.

[2.5L cooker](https://preview.redd.it/4ymx5gdjuph71.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde8035f2cc3f9aca311e02df703e472e614bb60)

Start by putting the flame on high and preheating the cooker, this also helps completely drying out the insides.Then add your beans and close the lid and start shaking the cooker. for the first 3-4 min you can do a gentle shake once in a while till the beans start turning golden and chaff starts releasing.

[Violent Shaking](https://reddit.com/link/p5fifo/video/p25ojfjfuph71/player)

As the color changes, you should keep shaking the cooker or the beans may get inconsistent roast levels. Keep opening and checking the color every minute and roast to your preferred level.

[Medium Roast](https://preview.redd.it/t21bp1hyuph71.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5d3d6913513995c7a5cf521395134fae4d45550)

[Medium Dark Roast](https://preview.redd.it/w5281vlzuph71.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56ce740500bccebc38d37df323e0bf28b10e936d)

Roast may seem a bit inconsistent in the photos but this was due to me stopping in between to click those shots.

Here, I am doing a medium dark roast, stopping just when the second crack starts. Took about \~12min to reach. And yes, the cracks are audible even if the lid is closed, they sound like popcorn popping. Time may vary depending on beans and roast level.

When your roast is complete, transfer the beans to a metal colander and wait till it cools down.

https://preview.redd.it/c9n0mam6vph71.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3fcf8d9c55c330807644f34a4b564b12432df28

The last step is removing the chaff. Since the roast was done in a closed container, all the chaff is mixed with the beans. To remove it, go outside and blow on the beans and shake the colander. Repeat till all chaff is blown away.

Please try to be descriptive about the taste if you can :)

I personally have been drinking 3 different beans from Blue Tokai rn:

* **Hoysala Estate** (Medium Roast) - I didn’t quite like it as a black coffee but enjoyed it through a south indian filter with milk and sugar. Was positively surprised that the “coffee” flavour and especially the acidity actually shone through all the milk and sugar.
* **Varadymalai Estate** (Light Roast) - Probably the best tasting out of the three or maybe I’m just more of a light roast person. It has a bright acidic taste but it tastes good with it’s slightly warm(?) and sweet caramel after-taste. The barista at my local Blue Tokai cafe suggested it to me for a light roast and it really turned out to be good. (He was extremely helpful and brewed an excellent pour-over for me)
* **Kerehaklu Estate** (Medium Roast) - This was a really good tasting coffee with its sweetness pouring out at the perfect places and not at all letting the bitterness overpower the brew. Also quite acidic imo but nothing that would make your taste buds shrivel. I picked it up because it was one of the coffees that was their seasonal harvest.

TLDR: Should I buy Moka pot in the range of 800-1100 INR or go for expensive ones? Is there an actual difference if I'm going to use it occasionally?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/pgzjwl/cheaping_out_on_moka_pot/

I recently ordered 3 flavours from Blue tokai, the 75gm (Attikan, French Roast, Orchardale).

It's my first time with speciality coffee and my usual coffee intake is in form of cold coffee with instant coffee and milk.

Currently I just have a French Press at my disposal, looking to get the hang of it before investing more. 

I have seen the James Hoffman French Press method, but it was water based and not milk. I wanted to know can I use the same method for milk based as well and how much should be the ratio? 

I enjoy iced coffee, so can I make it using the Hoffman method and then pour it over ice and then milk over that?

How are moka pot and aero press different compared to the French press? Will look to invest in either once I get into the habit of making speciality coffee.

An update to the above post I'd put up a few days ago. So I tried brewing it with a drip machine and the coffee honestly was very acidic and felt under extracted(I'm pretty sure me blade grinding it didn't help, I know, I know..) I then upped it to a 1:12 ratio and evened out my grind using paper towels James Hoffman style and the brew still tasted off. I added salt to see if I could remove some bitterness but nada. I sort of just gave up and blamed it on the coffee until I decided to cold brew it. 1:14 is what I went for and made myself a liter of coffee and let it steep for 22 hours. What emerged from my experienced failure was coffee that had almost zero acidity and a hint of sweetness, I was amazed. I'd finally made palatable coffee even with my uneven grind. Cold coffee never tasted so good. If this is what I can achieve with subpar blend coffee, I can't even imagine what something like a single origin would yield. Having enjoyed my results, I find myself deeper into the coffee rabbit hole, not that I'm complaining.

I'd desist personally from buying from coffeeworkz ever again in my life, as they don't even do proper packaging to ensure that the product doesn't get dented or bent or damaged during transit. Even a minor dent on an equipment, costly 5000+, is only a big disappointment along with bad paint finish and bad finish of aluminium that's used inside.

Because it's manufactured outside India and it does cost a lot relative to others, it doesn't mean it's that good atleast when it comes to aesthetics which matter!! In India and probably Asia, the quality of imported equipments or supplements or whatever you can find is often always far below the international quality.

Rest is upto you and your choice of choosing where and on what to spend money on. I haven't regretted buying timemore c2 though.

I'm very new to the speciality coffee scene, and I just found this subreddit. I have recently bought an Aeropress, and I have been experimenting with different coffee profiles from Blue Tokai. I recently bought the Harley Estate coffee (pre-ground for Aeropress) from them after seeing that it has some fruity notes, and from my previous experience of buying Orchardale Estate from them (the mango in that one is really delicious), I was expecting some great fruity flavour.

To my surprise, the aftertaste is very sour, like amla. I assumed at first that I was under-extracting the coffee, so I made sure to use a bit higher temperature than I was using earlier (I don't have a thermometer, but 30 seconds off the boil) and I can still taste that sour aftertaste without any sweetness, unlike Orchardale.

Is there anyone else who has tried brewing Harley who can confirm if it is supposed to taste like that? Is there any thing I can improve in my brewing process?

I am a new coffee addict and I have been looking at good ways to froth milk with steam without spending a bomb on a coffee machine or espresso maker. I usually brew my coffee with a filter, Aeropress, Moka pot. I like to have Latte/Cappuccino once a day but have not been able to make a decent cup of frothed or steamed milk. I have tried the mechanical frothers but they are all just a joke.

So I have decided to take matters into my own hands and with the help of a local fabrication workshop, I have made a wand that can be attached to the top of the pressure cooker (in the valve socket) and be used to steam the milk perfectly. 

* There is nothing like this available in the market today
* All other wands are meant for coffee machines or electrical steamers
* The results are amazing. Makes the best-steamed milk for latte art

I want a few of you to try out the pilot batch so that I can tweak the design a bit and then plan to launch a Kickstarter campaign for the same to get it manufactured in bulk and sell it.

Note: This is only the wand. The pressure cooker (1.5-2L) can be purchased for less than 1K INR and be used as a dedicated steamer for attaching this wand or you can just purchase an additional lid for your existing pressure cooker and add this wand to this lid and use it with the existing pressure cooker you would have. 

Price: I am selling the pilot wands for INR 500 + delivery charges (the cost to make it is INR 700). Once we go for bulk manufacturing, the costs can come down to INR 200 and we can sell it for less than INR 300. Add the price of the pressure cooker and you get a full-fledged steamer for &lt; INR 1k.

I am based out of Bangalore and I have \~20 pilot pieces to give for testing. Please let me know if you would be interested in the pilot testing. I will only be able to deliver within India (and ideally within Bangalore).

I've tried Blue Tokai's Vienna, Malabar and Nachammai roasts ebfore, but I'm afraid that I brewed them beyond their optimum consumption period. This time, I want to make sure that I try the different coffees at the same time, so that I can compare them effectively.

A few months back, I opened a cafe and we've been using a rented Expobar New Elegance 1 group machine (plumbed in) with inbuilt grinder. Now we're planning to buy a machine and Ive been talking to lavazza distributor since they have good service in my city (Agra).  Coffee volume is not very high per hour and single group machine is enough for now.

1GR Machines they're offering:

* Rancilio Classe 5 USB (inbuilt tank)
* Nuova Simonelli Musica (inbuilt tank)
* Nuova Simonelli Appia Life Compact (plumbed in)

The classe 5 and musica are similarly priced and appia life is a lot more expensive than both.

Grinders they're offering are Nuova Simonelli MCF and Nuova Simonelli MDX On Demand with on demand grinder being a lot more expensive.

So, which of the three (Rancilio Classe 5 USB vs Nuova Simonelli Musica vs Expobar New Elegance) is better ? Also, is appia life worth extra 50k ?

Received my new Aeropress. Received the medium roast sampler pack from KC. Super excited to brew my first coffee on the press. Used the Hoffman method. Coffee turns out super bitter, flat and paper-y. I chalk it up to being a noob.

Made my second brew with the same method with almost two months old Blue Tokai Silver Oak. The coffee turns out amazing, even restoring some of the lost aroma.

Opened another sampler pack from KC, same story. Received another medium roast coffee from a brand called Beans n Brews. The coffee was bitter in a good way and super smooth, and had sort of a distinctive taste as well. The brew with KC was once again horrible with the same method.

Am I going wrong or is there an issue with the beans?

Another very primary observation: Both the packs from KC smelt kind of burnt immediately after opening. Wasn't the case with BT or BnB.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/qscref/has_anyone_gotten_beans_from_kc_roasters_recently/

I was looking at the ariete vintage initially, but I understand from my reading that it is not very consistent / doesn’t make great coffee? Now, I’ve been torn between the lelit Anna with pid and the solis perfetta. I notice that many people seem to favour the gaggia classic pro as well. 
For grinders, I’m not really sure what to pick. I have a manual Hario, but I don’t think it’ll be able to do smaller grinds. Would the Baratza sette 30 or the solis scale fit the bill? 
Cost is also a factor- I am trying to ensure that I stay within a budget of around 65-70k . 
I’ll be grateful of any suggestions for a reliable, long lasting machine for a complete noob who is unlikely to tinker with / modify a machine . I primarily drink my coffee black- may occasionally do a milk based drink is all. 
Thank you !",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/qstdoi/newbie_seeking_help_on_beginner_espresso_machine/

And then there is the Nandan Coffee at the Bookstore.
I have tried and enjoyed all the above at their different locations except Nandan coffee. Here is my experience.
The Good : They have excellent setup with a beautiful bookstore and a mean looking espresso machine. On sale they have a range of their coffees and also a good selection of coffee equipment for sale (including the cafflano brewer featured at Morgan drinks coffee’s latest video).
The not so Good : I ordered pour over and asked them which beans they were using and they said “we use our own beans” but failed to tell me exactly which ones they were using out of what was available for sale. Also they used cloth filter bag that I do not personally like as what one gets is not pour over but something between pour over and French press (personal opinion). And the worst part was when I tasted the coffee it was extremely underwhelming. I wanted to try the espresso as well but it was past 7pm and I did not want to stay up all night.
Anyway, please do share your experience with Nandan coffee so I can decide if I want the bag from them (the bags are on expensive side from 500 to 900 rupees)!!! So I would not buy unless someone actually recommended those. Only plus point is they claim all their coffee is organic so if that is your main concern, you are covered.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/qtg97c/nandan_coffee_at_the_book_store_by_white_crow_at/

On this note, is having a kettle with a thermometer a must or are there ways to live without the temperature control?
Investing in the v60 itself isn't a big deal and it also has a steel filter variant which in theory sounds practical but people often love the brew from the paper filter. I already own an aeropress and moka pot; I also end up making channi coffee and cold brew when I'm in that mood.

I wanna go to the next step now : I'm in the process of buying a French Press, but I wanted advice on the blends, roasts + grounds. What I love about my morning cold brew is the ritual itself, the ice cubes cackling against each other, the sound of cold brew on ice, the beautiful mesmerizing design when the splash of my creamer falls on iced cold brew - it's so therapeutic. I wanna keep that meditative quality in mind while I proceed to the next step. So I have a lot of questions, please help a newbie! 
1. I honestly love the design + aesthetic of the French Press but is Aeropress or MokaPot or V60 better? I initially wanted to buy a coffee capsule machine but that's just too expensive for me right now so maybe later. I was really excited about doing latte art and espressos just seems creamy enough for that, will I be able to make beautiful lattes using a French press? Is the Morphy Richards 4 bar 800 Watts espresso machine worth it since it has a steamer too (which can be used for latte)? 
2. Coffee! Blends &amp; grinds - Which is your personal favorite blend and why? Of course I intend to experiment and play around a lot but I would love to stumble upon a blend that I could love black - even though I always love my coffee with milk &amp; sugar, I want to eventually be pleasantly surprised by a blend so good that I drink it black. Grounds! I do have an electric grinder so should I directly buy coffee beans? What's the difference, does it even matter? Is a manual grinder better than an electric grinder? The idea of grinding your own beans sounds exciting and scary at the same time. Also, I'm the only coffee drinker in my house, so would a 250gm bag be enough to last me a month if I drink a cup once a day? When do beans start going stale? Should I freeze them so that they last longer as I'm budgeting for a month? 
Lastly, I would love nothing more than to be a snob about this so please feel free to advice me on anything - even the questions I didn't ask here. So delighted to be a part of this community I've been stalking for weeks - everyone seems so amazing here haha help a girl out!

I ended up ordering a coffee grinder, French press (to froth milk for lattes), MokaPot, freshly roasted beans, Aeropess filter (for MokaPot) and I'm so excited! I wanted to buy an aeropess as well but I really splurged this time so next time lol!  Also got fancy latte cups like the ones you get in cafe &amp; a glass straw for whenever I am in the mood for cold brew. 
My only concern is, I am going to limit myself to only one cup a day as I don't want to overdo it, too much caffeine can trigger anxiety and what not, so here's the problem - I got a 3 cup MokaPot (150 ml) and apparently you can't make lesser than that so everytime that's the standard amount I'll have to make. 
I did some googling and arabica beans in a 150ml moka pot will brew 246 milligrams of caffeine. Isn't that a lot? Considering moka pot brews concentrated coffee? What's the solution as I'm the only coffee drinker in my house, should I return it for a 100ml moka pot that's available as a 1 cup, which will be about 164 milligrams of caffeine. I'm probably overthinking but I really don't want to overdo it. 
Lastly, I got the 650ml French press from insta cuppa but I read somewhere 350ml is the best for frothing milk? I'm so confused, should I return it too or would the 650ml one work just as well for foamy milk? The plunger goes down to 100ml mark, is that fine if I want to froth milk just for one person?

I been trying to find ways to get my latte to resemble the ones I get in good coffee shops. The creamy rich foamy milk.

I'm not into espresso/Americano (i.e) milk and sugar less variations of coffee, so I will not be using the French press for making actual coffee at all.

Now coming to the question, I have a cousin who’ll be coming to India from Kenya and I have the chance to get some coffee from there. However, I have no idea about what to get. I am very new to the ‘ground coffee’ (specialty coffee? Not sure what to call it) scene despite drinking coffee everyday for the last 6 years (I used to drink instant coffee). I recently got a french press from instacuppa and have been trying out different roasters, roasts, etc. 

Also, another problem is, my cousin will be coming to India next week but I’ll only meet him after 20 days. So by then the coffee would be three weeks old. Is it still worth it to get it from there? Will the coffee become stale?

• Equipment - French Press

• Type - I’ll be having it only black

• No grinder 

• Preference - No dark roast

It has been brought to the moderators' attention that there are some people in this subreddit who sell products through this sub. Although it is not illegal to sell products here, there is this particular case where a seller tried to influence an inexperienced member into buying a lower quality product. The member suspects that the seller tried to convince them to buy the lower quality product because they would earn some commission from it. 

Therefore, the newcomers here are advised to do their own research before buying something that someone suggests. There are good sources online which can help in buying products. This is not a buying/selling community and we don't want any distrust to grow here. 

Happy brewing!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/rgt8ka/beware_of_sellers/

However I'm now faced with a dilemma, the original filters have run out and I've been experimenting with alternatives. 
The moccamaster filters do a fairly decent job but there was a time I'd alternate between the moccamaster filter and clever dripper stock filters and there seemed to be a difference in the quality of my brews. The clever dripper stock filters seemed to deliver a slightly better cup and I cannot tell if it's just psychological.
That being said I saw some YouTube videos where people used v60 filters and just fold the bottom to sit well in the clever dripper, this brewed a fairly bitter and off tasting cup. 
I'm considering trying the melitta 1x4 filters next as I cannot find the clever dripper stock filters anywhere. 
Do chime in if you have a suggestion or opinion on the matter. 
Thanks. 

PS - I've tried the wobh fabric filter and it was an interesting experience but it works for smaller brews and the difference isn't enough for me to want to make it my regular filter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/rgzo7f/clever_dripper_filter_alternatives/

I have a tamper that fits my brewing chamber I simply tamp it (take the grounds that fall and simply add it back to the brewing chamber). You can also just add some water and let it bloom and than gently pour the water to maximize resistance.

91 degree water temp

50gm bloom for 30 seconds followed by 2 pours of 100gm each to finish the brew by 2:15

Ive been using the aeropress for quite a while now and ill be telling you my observation for how a really good cup of coffee can be made through using one!




1) Alright so ill start with the very main ingredient being used which is COFFEE! To begin with I would definitely recommend you to buy a good branded indian speciality coffee (bluetokai,blackbaza,flyingsquirrel etc), and not starbucks or CCD coffee , be it whole beans or pre ground as i have noticed that majority of the time their coffee beans are roasted very dark which i would definitely not recommend to a new user of Aeropress.






2) This is something which you can only decide through experimenting yourself but if you have just started to use an aeropress then I would recommend you to buy either a light roasted or a medium roasted coffee as you can extract the maximum amount of flavour (and money lol) through the beans. This leads us to the extraction of coffee.






3) coming to the extraction of coffee, the darker roast of coffee that you are using, the lower the temperature of the water should be. This is because darker roast requires less extraction and lighter roast requires higher extraction. If you need the exact temperature then for a dark roast i would recommend around 80-85c, for a medium roast it would be 90-95(pretty much boil the water and wait for 20 secs) and finally for a lighter roast, you can straight up use boiling water. 





This then co relates with the  amount of time you should extract (steep) the coffee in your aeropress. Now this is again something which you can check through experimenting yourself but what i have noticed is that for both a light roast and a medium roast, 3 minutes of steep time is the best and for a dark roast, around 2 minutes is the sweet spot!




Coming to which method you should use when making coffee in your aeropress, i would definitely recommend you to try the ultimate technique of aeropress by James hoffman on youtube and further experiment with that.

Added 175ml of water at 90C. Total brew time: 1min 10seconds (inverted position, paper filter).

I decided to go in for a bag of Vero decaf coffee (250gm). The result was pretty decent. The beans themselves were a medium-dark roast (advertised as medium roast), with a good aroma. The roast date was 27-12-2021. I prepared black coffee with the recipe above, no sugar added.

First impressions: the coffee has a noticeable taste that I think is a byproduct of the decaffeination process. It's a burnt, unpleasant taste. If you look past that taste, the coffee itself is quite good with a warm feel to it. I'm no coffee cupping expert so I can't describe it better.

If you go by their website, the coffee should deliver an Arabica-feel, which I agree. Moreover the taste is better than other decaf competition. In my experience decaf coffee from others tends to taste hollow and lack any pleasant coffee notes. I'm going to try and grind coarser in my next try to see if that helps eliminate some of the unpleasantness. I'm honestly going to enjoy this bag. Will I buy again, no - I'm having a hard time justifying the premium for decaf. Not paid by them or anything, this review is for the community.

I've recently got a French press and am looking for pre-ground coffee from Blue tokai. I'm quite new to brewing coffee on my own and have so far been using a South Indian filter. I've tried Devan's Viennese Blend and Monsooned Malabar before and I liked them.   
Any recommendations for the ones I can start with? I could go with a sampler pack with three different kinds of blends to learn what I like better, but not sure which one to pick.

Tasted very different from most of the other stuff from bluetokai. A little confusing to me honestly. Slight sweetish bitter taste that somehow seemed like a flowery taste.

I have some thermal flasks at home but they don't do the trick. See what I've observed so far is that I need to pour brewed coffee really slowly in-order to not disturb any sediment.  

My old French press, most cups &amp; glasses, and thermal flasks have blunt round edges. If i pour too slowly, coffee runs down along the outer wall. My steel cup otoh has a thin sharp edge and I can pour as slow as I want.

So I'm looking for either a insulated French press or a thermal flask that has similar characteristics, as in it allows one to pour coffee really slowly (preferably in 250-500 ml capacity)",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/s6t99k/french_press_or_thermal_flask_recommendation_for/

1.) **Jumping Ant - Black Baza Coffee:** This light roast works really well as cold brew. A very refreshing citrusy taste. 

2.) **Loris - Black Baza Coffee:** A very distinctive, dark taste that pairs really well with milk. I typically brew a concentrate using an aeropress and add some frothy milk.

3.) **Cold Brew Blend Bold - Blue Tokai:** Dark &amp; nutty, this is not a bad coffee but I've realized I prefer a lighter roast for my cold brew.

4.) **Silver Oak Cafe Blend - Blue Tokai:** A well balanced coffee with a hint of fruit and honey. Works well as Americano.

5.) **Birthday Blend - Blue Tokai:** Got a 100gm pack free with my order. Pleasantly surprised with this one. I enjoyed the creamy &amp; fruity taste and feel. Works well as Americano.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/sblylv/coffee_reviews_black_baza_blue_tokai/

First post here. Great community, and I appreciate everybody's time in helping out fellow coffee enthusiasts.

I know this sub already has a number of espresso machine recommendation posts. Kindly bear with me.

I have been using my 1Zpresso K-Pro with Aeropress, V60 mainly. Love both. (I should mention I like the coffee from Fellow Stagg X as well)

Coming to espresso, I tried using Nanopresso with not so great results. Not bad, but just not great. I recently bought the Fellow Prismo attachment for Aeropress, which I really like. Very different but good ""espresso-like"" results.

So decided to plunge into the espresso world. Have ordered DF64 /w SSP Multipurpose burrs. Getting delivered mid Feb. Will share the shipping and customs experience after I receive it. Wanted to go for Lagom P64 but decided will save on that. May be in the future can go for Lagom P100 or the upcoming Acaia Orbit.

Now looking for a good long-term espresso machine. This would be my first espresso machine of any sorts. I drink black and family drinks milk based coffee. Would want to buy an espresso machine available in India/Bangalore. Have shortlisted below options.

**Category 1:**

* Lelit Elizabeth
* Profitec 500
* Rancilio Silvia Pro

**Category 2: (stretching my budget)**

* Lelit Bianca
* Profitec 700 /w Flow Profiler

Would love to go for Profitec 800 as lever based machine looks appealing, but apparently, the heat up time is close to 40 minutes!

Seen/read enough reviews and not able to make up my mind.

Or as my first espresso machine for Gaggia Classic pro or something similar? Are there any other machines I should look into?

Thank you for your inputs.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - 15/03/2022: **Grinder Update:** Received my DF64 grinder SSP MP (from [df64coffee.com](https://df64coffee.com)) on 3rd March. Have been using it for 2 weeks. And it is great. Using it with all possible mods. Had also SSP HU burrs. Planning to change the burrs and use them after some time.

**Espresso Machine Update:** Ordered Lelit Bianca. Expecting arrival end of March/early April.

A few people reached out to me regarding the grinder purchase experience from [df64coffee.com](https://df64coffee.com). It was good. Their customer support was also very responsive. The only issue was with Aramex and Customs, and delays caused by them. Feel free to ping me with any specific questions.

Is there a better espresso machine for a beginner? Would I be better off just buying an AeroPress?

Tbh, I am not very educated about coffee and the nitty gritties. Blue Tokai was a recommendation from an old friend. The reason I make cold brew is because it takes the least amount of time, I make it once and store it in the fridge. 

I want to explore more and also learn more coffee. But from now, I would like recommendations for different brands. I prefer the smoky taste of the dark roast but I want something stronger.  

I was checking out Home Blends, Black Baza and Rage coffee. I'm leaning the most towards Home Blends. I'd like your opinions once.

Came in a beautiful green hard case and 2x100g glass jars. Gorgeous to look at and hold but not sustainable. At Rs. 855 / 200gms, perhaps I already paid this off and some more.

\- Aroma: Blew my socks off. A distinctive &amp; powerful fruity aroma. I haven't tried many specialty coffees in my life (a few blends from Blue Tokai, Black Baza and Caffena), but the ones I have tried pale in comparison.

\- Flavor: I brewed this using an Aeropress and consumed it as an iced americano. The cupper's notes are rose water, pineapple compote and papaya juice. Perhaps it's just psychological but I can taste all of these notes. Overall, a very complex &amp; fruity flavor that I really enjoyed.

This is certainly one to try if you can stomach the steep price!

**Flavor:** Brewed using an aeropress (iced americano) and a hario brewpot (cold brew). A smooth, rich &amp; dark flavor with very subtle hints of fruitiness. This should work really well in milky drinks.

This has the potential to be a good daily driver. It's also priced well at Rs.420 / 250gms. It is perfect for those days when you aren't feeling experimental and just need a good old classic black coffee.

My review of the coffee:

1. The beans seemed to be quite different (looks wise) from the ones I order from BT. This has nothing to do with the coffee, just something I noticed.
2. The aroma hits you the moment you open the bag. I brewed a pour over and my sister could smell it from her room - it is bit far away from the kitchen.
3. V60 - I tried various recipes. Finally the thing that worked for me is ratio - 1: 16 (approx). I start with 16g coffee, 60g initial pour and a swirl, bloom for around 25 secs, pour in two batches of 100g each with a swirl in between. What I found, when I used more coffee, the fruity taste was a bit overwhelming. 
4. Aeropress - Honestly I found the Aeropress far better with this coffee. 10g coffee, 180g water in two pours of 90g each with a stir and bloom of 30 secs. It worked magic. I completed the coffee predominantly with my Aeropress. 

Couldn't try their Mind=Blown as it was out of stock. Ordered Savorworks Fruitbomb and BT - Ratnagiri H1. Will post review soon",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/ssg09s/kaapi_kottai_curveball_review/

1. I increased my coffee to water ratio from 1:16 to 1:17
2. A large first pour (50 g water for 15g coffee)
3. Adopting an aggressive and large pour after the bloom (A continuous pour of 205 g water in 40-45 seconds.)
4. Remove the V60 between 2 min 30 sec to 2 min 45 sec on the timer, even if the entire coffee has not poured out.
5. An iced pour over can also help.

This coffee has brought me excitement to the time I consume coffee. I genuinely look forward to it. And, after quite sometime I prefer V60 than aero press (of late, I started liking aero press to V60 for most of the coffees I buy. 

Pourover recipe: I followed the same recipe BT suggested with 2 variations. Grind- I go little fine than pourover size (around 14/15 clicks in Timemore C2). Water temp 95. 

3 pours - 75ml, 125ml and 50ml. Bloom 25 secs and 1 min between 125ml pour and 50ml pour. Last change from BT recipe: I top up with 20ml water at 95 degrees. 

The coffee just sings in your palate. So yum that I am tempted to stock up before it goes out of stock. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aeropress: After the pourover, I tried Hoffman recipe in aero press. But it doesn't live upto V60 cup I made. Maybe I will try BT recipe and update the review.

I drink coffee for the flavour and not any stimulant effects (in fact it makes me drowsy) so there's no daily routine. And I realize my brewing method will be way too casual for most aficionados but here goes: 

- hot water in the bottom chamber till the valve
- eyeball the ground coffee until there's a slight mound, no tamping 
- on the stove until the coffee starts spurting/turns light brown then immediately pour 
- drink it black with a bit of sugar or (more likely) make VIC or an iced latte or a coffee mojito 

The bitterness level in this coffee is pretty high when had black, probably not the best for a beginner like me, but I feel it pairs well with milk. Can't get the chocolate notes at home, probably because of my equipment or the use of preground coffee. 

Would love to hear about your experiences with this blend! And any notes on my process + things to try :)

Sidenote: Vienna Roast was another blend I enjoyed as VIC! Devan's Mysore Nuggets was great too, but definitely more on-the-nose bitterness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/t47x2e/lets_talk_about_blue_tokais_dhak_blend/

I realize this may have been a bit of a mistake since I still haven't brewed a coffee that I really enjoyed. 

I tried Corridor Seven's Baarbara Estate first and am currently on Sleepy Owl's French Vanilla. Both of them taste almost the same to me except for a hint of vanilla in the latter. For some reason, they're sour but bitter at the same time. The C7 coffee was ground for Moka pot, while the SO Vanilla was ground for Aeropress and pourover. They turned out to be the same size. 

I also can't fill the moka basket completely with coffee without it burning. It only works with less coffee in it. I've tried different amounts of water, different temperatures of water, and different heat levels. I've watched Hoffman and many other youtubers but nothing I do gives me a good coffee. A room temp start seems to work the best. The only thing left for me to try is getting a coarser grind.

I'd love it if you guys could offer some tips on what I should do. If you could also give me some recommendations for light to medium roasts that would be great, since I prefer less bitterness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/t4rw8i/help_with_moka_potcoffee_recommendations/

I have a Baratza Encore and a Mahlkonig branded Vario sitting with me and not getting much use. I would like to sell these. 

The Encore is equipped with the M2 burr upgrade. It was bought in India through an official Baratza reseller. 

The Vario is Mahlkonig branded but is identical to the Baratza version. I have swapped the burrs to the Ditting made steel burrs which I bought directly from Baratza. I have the calibration tool for this grinder available as well.

I have a couple of other less mainstream grinders which I would like to dispose of. Ever since I got my endgame grinder none of the others see much use and I think I would rather have someone else have it who can use it more than me.

To start things off, a lot has been said &amp; dug up lately in a post by [/u/sexysantaz2021lol](https://www.reddit.com/user/sexysantaz2021) calling us out with ""sneaky marketing tactics"". Further, in the comments, we went through, we also noticed a lot of doubts and questions about the transparency and freshness of our coffees.

We would love to take these up and be happy to solve any further doubts you guys have. We hope you take the time and lend an ear to our side of the narrative as well.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Sexy Santa's Order -**  The moment the post was put up we reached out asking for the order details and offered to be open to any way to solve the query. **We are yet to receive any proof of order or response on the same.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Transparency -** The coffees in our collection at the moment are not Single Estate coffees, but the blends that we developed in house from multiple estates, thus we haven't revealed them as it didn't seem to be all that helpful as you can notice even many famous roasters **have done the same with their home blends. However, if you are still keen on having complete transparency, we are more than happy to reveal the estates for each blend in the days to follow.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **The freshness of Roasts -**  If you would spare the time to go through our **150+ comments** on this community, we have at multiple times clarified that **we roast our coffee every Friday and dispatch immediately after degassing the same.** (To be even more clear in communicating this info, we have taken up your feedback and added the same to our website as well).

&amp;#x200B;

* **Marketing Tactics -**  Now, finally addressing the elephant in the room. To take you through this we would be more than happy to invite you to go through all of our comments (any user or mod that feels it is necessary). You will notice that at no point have we specifically pointed out our **coffee being ""superior""** to others, we have completely **refrained from commenting on any coffee recommendation post.** Even in our AMA posts, the most we have ""promoted"" our product has been a simple link to our website.

&amp;#x200B;

* Almost all of our activity lies in these comments and they are all pretty much targeted at **solving people's doubts and queries in how to brew better and understand the ins and outs of a rather complex specialty coffee world.** Our suggestions &amp; answers have been deeply appreciated by OPs in most cases. In these comments, we do suggest some of our coffees, but those are out of simple pairing recommendations in case the community finds itself on our website after going through the post.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Pricing -**  Many people in the community have also inquired with us regarding our prices, and for those who have tried it know for a fact that the **affordability is in no way a sign of poor quality**. It has always been our goal to make coffee more accessible &amp; affordable for daily drinkers without compromising on the quality.

Of course, this doesn't deny any outliers, which exists with every brand/roaster as coffee has always been a very subjective topic.

If anyone in the community has had any doubts or feedback for us we have always been **direct and fairly quick to respond** &amp; have in fact multiple times taken it up and even inculcated it into our practices.

&amp;#x200B;

As that has always been our goal of being here in the community.

We look forward to your understanding, thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/tk1s4s/lets_talk_clear_it_out/

Initial impressions - not so happy, I guess I got accustomed to light roasts which are treated very well

I followed BT recipe - Add 16g coffee and start the timer. Pour 100ml water at 96deg celcius and stir 5 times. After 1 minute, add another 75ml water. After 1:30 seconds, add 75ml water (250ml total) and swirl a couple of times again. Let the brew drip down.

I did not like that recipe. I felt I did not extract the flavours of the coffee, it felt inadequate with multiple grind setting adjustments. 

Then I remembered one technique: I guess Tetsu's 

I used same 16gm coffee ground little finer than regular pourover grind and same water temperature but I split the pour of 250gm to five 50gm water pour. I was impressed with the result - incredibly complex, slight sweetness.

This was the fifth time ordering from the roaster, so I'm both familiar with the coffee and confident about the consistency of the product. The roast date on the bag was ten days prior to when I received it, which in my opinion isn't something to hyperventilate about since I'd let the coffee rest for a while anyway. However, I have just not been getting the same results with the coffee and it made me wonder if transit times also become a variable in coffee's freshness, given how hot it already is and how much worse it's going to get. Or am I just overthinking it and coffee doesn't stale at a rate that I'm imagining? It's possible that I received a below average roast batch but I wanted to know if all of you ever take this into consideration? Or if anyone knows how coffee is handled by couriers (most coffees arrive in a cardboard box with not much room, add to that any kind of exposure to heat/Sun in the vehicles)",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/tpdb7f/coffee_deterioration_in_cargo/

Now my question is the small portion of coffee, does it alter the taste a lot, or will i have any reduced acidity or increased sweetness if i throw that part out before the final plunge.

I got the black baza filters yesterday and I tried brewing with it. I treated it same as paper filters while brewing. Surprisingly or not so surprisingly the water passed from the filter very very quickly, almost instantly. When I use the same recipe with filter papers it takes 2.50-3.00 minutes to brew (ultimate v60 technique). Using the same recipe with cloth filters, my brew finished in 1.50-2.00 minutes. Naturally the coffee tasted very under extracted.

Is this normal? Are there any hacks around it? How has your experience been using any cloth filters for v60?

Instacuppa's rechargeable milk frother costs 1200 (i know those are just rebranded Chinese products, but their customer service is good and they replace the product without question in case of issues within the first year, so my experience with the brand has been good)

Subminimal nanofoamer costs about 3600 and I've seen really nice pictures of latte art with it.


Now, i prefer milk coffees and love the texture of frothed milk. Since I'm going to be using it everyday, has anyone here used nanofoamer regularly for a long time?

I just re-watched [James Hoffman's video on water](https://youtu.be/jfElZfrmlRs), and he recommends the following water specifications for coffee:

* Buffer · 50–⁠75 ppm
* Calcium · 30–⁠50 ppm
* Magnesium · 15–⁠30 ppm

My question is, what water do people here generally use for coffee? Tap water, RO-filtered water, any other type of filter? Do you / would you consider making your own water from distilled water, epsom salts, and baking soda? Have you tasted any differences between various waters where you live?

Ordered on: 3 Apr
Received shipping notification on: 11 Apr
Delivered on: 16 Apr

Upon receiving the bag, my only concern was that the coffee had been roasted on 4 Apr. So it was already almost 2 weeks past roast.

I had to tell myself to stay positive as I'd tried their Marx before and had liked it.

But the Nietzsche surprised me. Pleasantly.

Took me a couple of attempts to dial it in, but I like it well enough to make it my morning daily driver

It's a very clean cup of coffee with balanced sweetness and acidity. I can taste berries and cream with a lingering toasted grain aftertaste

Now, I'm looking forward to trying their other offerings too

Packaging - Nice, not something to rave about. But I like simple cardboard less environment waste than some lavish packaging. After all, we are here for what's inside. 

Coffee - Oh my! It blew my mind. I used a simple slightly altered (Hoffman recipe + Blue Tokai recipe). 

Grind - Bit finer than store pourover grind. 

Water - 250 ml at 90degrees ( I reduced 5 degrees from my standard 95 degree since it is a medium roast)

Recipe - 

1. 50ml and bloom for 35 seconds - few stirs (I don't count)
2. 100ml for next 1 min - stir or swirl (based on my mood)
3. 100ml and do nothing - watch a YouTube video till it drips down

They view me as a coffee connoisseur(perhaps a snob in their head). I headed to a nearby speciality coffee place (not naming the place / not CCD types). 

Me: What's the latest roast you have? Perhaps a single estate

Barista: \*\*\* Blend we use to make pourover

Me: Any single estate light roast

Barista shows me a coffee which is roasted 1 month back. 

Me: The blend would do

&amp;#x200B;

While I was discussing something with my friends, I couldn't help but notice from the corner of my eyes that the Barista has gone for a minute away to cater an online order while my coffee was blooming. I was thinking to myself, ""Can I step in and do the second pour.""

Watching him gave me such an anxiety. I told my friends, ""This is why I make my own coffee.""

&amp;#x200B;

This made me remember some years back, I visited their first cafe. The owner and I talked about the coffee they procure, how they process, how they roast and he explained the mechanism of pour over. The first sip I had, made me never go back to filter coffees. I bought the entire array of essentials of pour over. But, what I recalled most was that the owner had trained the barista to make brilliant cup of coffee.

I ordered a pre ground pack of Aromatique, light roast from Flying Squirrel. The grind size I selected was French press (possibly a mistake, in hindsight). 
I followed the regular 4 min and plunge method and then the Hoffman technique and the latter definitely produced better results.

Here's the thing though, I have no idea what that particular roast should taste like if brewed correctly. Even after using the Hoffman technique it felt quite earthy and sour (I think). My palate isn't developed at all so I couldn't identify any other notes except for just the general acidic coffee taste which I thought was expected as it was a light roast and the pack also mentioned it in the description. The water I used was perfectly fine, no funny taste whatsoever and I used it after keeping it off the heat for 20-25s after boiling. I didn't dislike the coffee in particular but I think there's definitely a way to brew it better.

Now I have ordered a sampler pack from Bloom Coffee Roasters, one light, one medium and one dark roast. I messed up again by ordering the French press grind instead of medium. 

Please help me so that I can brew it correctly using the press. Was my previous experience just a case of under-extraction (the roast was fresh and I consumed it within 2 weeks).

Grind size: French press.
Roast date: 23rd May. 
Used filtered water almost right off the boil.
15 gm coffee to 250 gm water.
Poured in a bit of water to submerge all evenly laid grounds in the press and gave it 4-5 stirs to agitate it. Poured in the rest and gave a couple gentle stirs.
Left it for 4:30 and stirred gently and removed some sludge off the top (Hoffman's method).
Waited for 6 more minutes.
Started tasting/drinking when it was a bit cool (ideal temp).

Tasting notes: Strawberries, a hint of chocolate and Almonds

The ground and the brew both smelled fresh but nothing special or noteworthy.
I could only taste the 'coffee' bit in it. It was very slightly acidic and overall wasn't bad.

The issue though is that I tried my best to identify any hints of other notes in it but nope, nothing. I understand that sometimes hints are too subtle or perhaps a 'strawberry' tasting note might not actually indicate a taste of strawberries, but I feel like I'm messing something up. The light and dark roasts I ordered along with this both had some character and I enjoyed them.

Surely something has to be wrong, I feel like I'm doing injustice to this particular medium roast by brewing it incorrectly. It definitely wasn't over-extracted since there was no uncharacteristic bitterness or astringency, but I think I did all I could to avoid under-extraction if that even is an issue in this case.

Seemed like a good light roast to start of with. Honestly, having tried a variety of international light roasts and after a recent buy of a light roast from Costa Rica (which had a beautiful lingering taste and the active notes being on the lines of passion fruit, such roasts are pretty hard to come by ), sorry, I digress; so 2 French Press' of Ananthgiri, beautiful monsson clouds setting in..the taste buds witness a good gulp. First impression: body is light but has a good complex flavour profile going on. A few more gulps down, it becomes easy to discern the flavours. Raisin is a really prominent one with a scattered  fruity background of guava, plum and a slight citric taste. Has medium-light acidity and the body actually goes perfect with the flavour. After a slight drop in temperature of the coffee, the mango note comes a bit more in the front with everything else remaining quite stable. 

Coming to the caffeine kick -it's good, promotes good focus with a nice elevation in energy, nothing too rash.  


Overall, a very good buy. If you are into light roasts this is a very good one to get into if you want to go for this roasterie. Will be buying more from this and hopefully if you guys like it, will be posting more detailed reviews. Do drop any comments or questions you might have.

Coming straight to the coffee, I brewed it in a french press multiple times before writng this review just to be sure about the taste notes and consistency. Alright then, Shinzo 3.0 is a very atypical light roast. It almost borders medium-light but it's not quite there, quite a unique charachterstic and I like it. The acidity is quite low and goes well with  the medium-light body the coffee possesses. You get a fresh taste with every gulp comprising of berries and a stone fruit flavour also some very faint earthy notes. The sad part is, the taste flattens out real fast even before you can relish it. This makes the whole experience not quite an enriching one. The after taste is a typical boozy which stays longer than the active taste notes of the coffee itself.Overall, I am not quite impressed with the Shinzo 3.0 but would be willing to taste other roasts they have to offer and hopefully will have a better experience.

**Coffee brewing method: French Press**

**20gms of coffee : 500ml of water / Water Temp: Approx 90-95 degrees**

Background:

Around a month ago a friend mentined Subko to be and absolutely swore by it. To quote: "" We have settled on these two '..' roasts and I refuse to go for anything else "" I chucked a bit to be honest. First, because he wasn't ready to try the light-roasts which I had been egging him to do so for long and he had become a straight medium-roast guy, unwilling to give some complex ones a shot. However though, keeping my nonsensesical biases aside, I went for Subko. Scrolled through the catalogue and honestly I liked their naming and description, quite neat and to the point.

The grounded ones arrive way within time and big-ups to Subko for that. Coming to the coffee, it's as the aussies say a complete bonza!. Why the hell haven't I tried Subko before1? Maybe this is what you get for being highly opioniated. The press is poured out and it is an absolute bliss to see the pour with a good background of sunlight..yeah yeah..cup is full. Let's take the gulps. Silky smooth creamy structure and this is the nuttiness I like, not too overly dry but goes well with the buds because of the caramel kinda thing that compliments it. The body is what a medium-light should have - bold and slightly round overall. Acidity is also quite right: mild to moderate. With the gulp, you have this fleshy tanginess of jackfruit at the back end and has a very pleasant almost sweet and fruity lingering after-taste. People shouldn't worried about the caffeine kick, the addiction will be fuelled.

I ordered a bag after countless gleaming reviews and recommendations and the tasting notes were something I’d never tried before. I do not own a grinder so I ordered it pre-ground for the Aeropress.

The first bag I received smelled burnt, and exactly like soil after a heavy rain. I was told to expect some pleasant fruitiness, but this was most certainly not there. I nevertheless decided that I had to brew it before judging it and some observations were very concerning:

1) There was a very, very minimal bloom. Yes, I know I shouldn’t expect much CO2 from pre-ground but I order from a new roaster every two weeks, and I always see a fair amount of bubbles escaping.

2) Upon adding more water after the bloom, the mixture became bizarrely frothy. I have never seen this before.

3) The final result had absolutely no acidity whatsoever. Light and medium roasts almost always have this trait, if I’m not mistaken.

So, heavily disappointed with the bag I received, I asked for a replacement and detailed everything I observed. I got the replacement, and it has all the problems the previous bag had.

I wish to ask for a refund, but I’m unsure if I’ll get it considering I was given a second bag.

I hope you guys found the reviews useful and of some help at least.

Coming to the point: I finally have some time on my hand as I prepare for my thesis defence to do these reviews and have been thinking of putting them on a wordpress blog. Starting small here but will remain consistent. Why wordpress? I honestly don't want to fall down the rabbit hole of promoting myself on IG / Fb etc. It's just not my thing. My priorities lie in the field of Physics and coffee tasting and reviewing is just a hobby. But if it helps others in choosing the right roast, helps them save some bucks by reading these reviews etc I'll be a happy camper.

Has anyone here tried switching from FrenchPress to AeroPress and found the coffee quality to be significantly better? Please share your experience and advice. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/vvqnsb/is_switching_to_aeropress_from_frenchpress_worth/

Context - I have a french press right now, and I am looking to buy my next gear to get a better flavour in my coffee.

1. Is it worth buying a coffee grinder? I usually finish my pre-ground coffee within a month, and the roasters would have much better appliances to produce a consistent grind. Can a fresh (but possibly inconsistent) grind from a manual grinder be lot better than slightly stale (but consistent) grind from roasters like BT, Savorworks?
2. Otherwise, is it better to get a Aeropress first to get a better coffee concentrate?
3. If your recommendation is a coffee grinder, which one would you recommend from your experience? I can spend upto 4-5K.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/w3ey6j/looking_for_advice_should_i_buy_a_coffee_grinder/

I use a south Indian filter and have only tried the cheap ones before such as Jayanthi, cothas, and 7 beans, and always preferred drinking them with milk.

I brewed the coffee just now and thought of sipping it without the milk and damn I was surprised. I've never tasted a coffee like this. The cheap ones which I used to buy were extremely bitter and could not be drunk without milk.

This tasted sweet, not bitter, and chocolatey, coated my mouth, left a pleasant aftertaste, and surprisingly tastes much better without milk.

Only going to be tinkering with pre ground powder for the next few months to a year until I invest in a proper grinder.

It is now that I have started drinking coffee black. And therefore, I have also ordered a few coffee trial packs from Kappi Kottai to see what I like. I currently have the CCD Dark Forest. I dislike it a lot as it is mostly bitter. Only today I brewed it in relatively lower temperature water that resulted in a less bitter brew. I also tried the inverted method today. However, since I reduced the temperature also today, I am unsure if it was the lower temperature or the newer method that caused the brew to be better.

I use the Aeropress to make my coffee using Tim Wendelboe method (water-&gt;stir-&gt;wait-&gt;stir-&gt;plunge). So far i have been getting good coffee using this method (In my limited experience).
Generally I used to get my coffee online so it was never the freshest batch but it was never really bad. Recently i moved to a city where there are some coffee places that sell coffee beans and ground coffee. Just last week i bought a bag of pre-ground Monsoon Malabar aa- Hoysala Estate from BT which was ground just 2 days prior. The coffee that I made using the same recipe blew my mind away!! I can't exactly describe it but it was wayyy better than the coffee that I was having. After drinking that coffee I realized why people buy grinders and grind their coffee everyday.
So I placed an order of Timemore Chestnut C2 Grinder and it should be arriving sometime this week.
Now coming to the main point in this story. I would like some help in buying coffee that tastes good and also some recommendations on how many clicks(?) should i use on my Timemore.

Coffee that i have tried and enjoyed : Attikan Estate from BT(liked this one because this is the only time that i felt a subtle taste of Figs from the tasting notes), Ratnagirifrom KC Roasters, Ficus from Black Baza.

I have tried at least 30 coffees from different roasters (sample packs) but the above 3 stand out the most.

Although I don't dislike light roasts, i would prefer medium or dark coffee, but if you think there is a great light roast i would still try it.

TIA.

I just really enjoy the app and think people here could find it helpful.

[Cofi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.omelan.cofi) is an open source, ad-free, minimal brew timer app that lets you create your own 'recipes' with different steps with the ability to add your coffee dosage and water amount and any other custom steps you would want. Also supports native Android PiP support so you can have a floating window while using other apps on your phone. There's a few default recipes to demonstrate how it works which can help you create your own. The developer is active and frequently adds new features and fixes bugs.

Out of all the apps I've tried on Android, this one worked the best for me and is simple and ad free unlike most of the other options.

Coffee to me used to be instant coffee with milk. Then I graduated to premium instant coffee like Davidoff. Then since a year I have been brewing my own coffee using French Press and buying pre-ground coffee like BlueTokai, Kapi-Kottai, SixteenGrams etc etc. It has been a year.

Now I want to up my game. What is the next logical step? My options are:

\- buying a grinder, buying roasted whole beans and grinding my own coffee.

\- buying a scale to see if my ratios are correct or not?

\- changing the brew method, &amp; buying AeroPress/MokaPot/Espresso machine etc

I want to know what should be my next purchase/step? Is the difference between pre-ground coffee and grinding my own coffee huge? If yes I might invest in Timemore Chestnut C2 Grinder. Any suggestions welcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/x2encz/what_next_after_preground_coffee/

[14gm in, 28gm out](https://preview.redd.it/y2hewcni82l91.jpg?width=1142&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f430fc846718571e15289fc059e3b1dc580a0b1)

&amp;#x200B;

After brewing over 250 shots in a year, I think I have got my return on investment on this one.

At home I use an Baratza Encore grinder and french press for frothing. I use a Timemore black mirror scale for timing and weighing.

I pull 1:2 shots consistently. And from bean to cup to cleaning, I am able to manage my workflow within 5 minutes. I am able to do that on repeat.

Here are my observations:-

\*\*Pros\*\*

1. Super Light Weight (About 180gm)
2. Cheap (INR 5000/-)
3. Minimal clutter. Everything fits snugly.
4. Naked Basket/Portafilter
5. Brews at espresso pressures(yes, it does 9 bars on demand)
6. Minimal Thermal management (Very little heat loss)
7. No need for an expensive grinder. Works well with Timemore C2 and similar
8. Easily available replacement/upgrade parts
9. Extremely good for Dark, Medium-Dark and Medium roasts
10. Aeropress like dry pucks

\*\*Cons\*\*

1. Mostly plastic
2. Possible to break O-ring, gasket, or portafilter if not careful
3. Can't measure pressure or temperature
4. Tamper has brand logo which trims the puck a bit
5. Struggles a little with light roasts
6. Ideally not for a novice, there is bit of a learning curve

\*\*Verdict\*\*

9/10

Must buy for backpackers if you need good espresso on the go

I carry a Timemore C2, Jewellery Scale, French Press, Cafflano Kompresso and Aeropress Go in my travel kit. All fit nicely in a small box. This product is for someone who wants a good espresso/cappuccino experience while they travel. The idea is to minimize weight in the baggage while getting a near espresso experience.

For those of you who want to buy it, the only accessory I recommend is a screw in dosing ring and WDT. The dosing ring can be 3D printed and WDT can be DIY. Contrary to popular belief, this brewer has the capability of pulling shots at 9 bar, but recommend a really good grinder for that, otherwise you may end up breaking the delicate basket. I generally tend to max it at 7 bar, which gives me a very decent brew. On some days, I bring it up to 8 bar. I did the maths by pulling some shots over a weight scale. 54kg of downforce equals 9 bar. I have tried as high as 57 kg once.

I consider this to be my best investment after the Aeropress. Bought it from Benki Brewing Tools

Started with my Keto diet, and one of the few beverages I could have aplenty was coffee. Back then, I bought a South Indian filter coffee brewer, and used some pre ground coffee from Barista. It was good. Then I found an Olx advertisement for a Morphy Richards espresso maker. Bought it. The coffee was acceptable. 

By then, I started enjoying coffee black. Then I started searching for an easier method to brew coffee and stumbled across the Aeropress. I found that Blue Tokai had coffee brewed by Aeropress in their menu. Decided to give it a try, and fell in love with it immediately. Bought it there and then, with ground Attikan Estate beans, and the Barista there was kind enough to teach me the method. 

6 years and many equipments (Hario Siphon, Nanopresso, etc) later, Aeropress still remains my preferred method to brew a cup daily. I pair it with the JX-Max Pro grinder now, and French Roast beans from Blue Tokai, or Sumatra Beans from Starbucks. I feel I've found my Holy Grail in terms of equipment and beans.

Should I get some specific sort of FP, I have a very cheap one with nothing but a mesh (I have added a picture below).

P.S: I don't use a pitcher and this is the FP I use.

- Add 4 tablespoons of ground indian filter kaapi to Aeropress.

What were your top 5/top 10 beans and from what roasters? I’ve tried many, if not all roasters and I’ll list my not so diverse, slightly biased rankings below. Slightly biased because i factor in my own tastes (leaning towards juicy, floral and citrusy and not nutty), availability, cost and the aftertaste, and how well it goes with cigarettes, and how I felt the caffeine content is. They’re all made on aeropress or a french press, and all have been tried on a friend’s Lelit Anna at least once. I’m not factoring in foreign coffee by Indian roasters, because they’re rarer than a mewtwo and never seem to be in stock. I’m not a professional and this is just musings of an average, naive enthusiast

1. Its a tie: Corridor Seven’ Riverdale N72 and BT’s producer series’ from Riverdale
2. Kappi Kottai Curveball. Went out of stock pretty quick, but so good, god damn. 
3. BCR’s Papakuchi. Tons of fun and affordable
4. Kappi Kottai’s mind=blown. Got the recommendation from this sub, wasn’t disappointed
5. C7’s Kerehaklu red honey process. Again, cheap and has pronounced notes. Its very, very versatile. 
6. BT’a Harley Estate. Deserves to be in a higher position in the hierarchy but for some reason, its lesser known or talked about. Maybe people just buy riverdale since its the same money. Great rich tastes, feels good even on a frenchpress with lesser filtration. Fine ass espressos on a machine. 
7. BT’s silver oak blend. Cheap, reliable and gives consistent cups of coffee. On most days, this is my daily driver at work. 
8. BT’s howdia estate. Charming coffee with more coffee and less notes. Subpar espresso or americano. 


What I’m yet to to try but its next:

1. Kapi Kottai’s bahar. They wont bring it out till next year, but a similar coffee is being released in a couple weeks. 
2. C7’s entire range, heard they’re pretty good. 
3. Savorworks Heisenberg
4. Coffee from Subko. I’ll start with their light roasts.

u/EndlessDesire,Recommendation for buying brewing equipment (aero press &amp; timemore c2 vs DeLonghi EC685M with pressurised filter and pre-ground),3,2022-09-20 16:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/xj63jt/recommendation_for_buying_brewing_equipment_aero/,"I recently found this sub and had a great time going through some of the quality posts here. I am looking to upgrade my coffee equipment this Diwali which currently comprises of budan 6 cup moka pot and a morphy richards 5 bar “espresso” machine (which frankly just wastes good pre ground coffee I buy).

My options are:
1.	Aeropress along with timemore c2 grinder (7.5k total) - Will be picking up whole beans and freshly grind them before making coffee, I don’t mind waiting 5-7 minutes for brewing the coffee as long as it tastes good
2.	[Delonghi EC-685M](https://www.amazon.in/DeLonghi-EC685-R-1300-Watt-Espresso-Metallic/dp/B06WGTZ874) (~17k) - Will continue to use pre ground coffee and pressurised filter until I can invest in an espresso level grinder in a year or so. I am a bit concerned about service issues with Delonghi though based on Amazon reviews.

In terms of requirements, I mainly drink americano and milk based variations like cappuccino/latte, never espresso shots directly. Also I mostly need to make coffee for max 2 people in a day. Budget is under 20k. Any suggestions here would be really helpful :)

Edit: Thanks everyone for their suggestions! I’ve settled down on timemore c2 + aeropress since it will add a lot more versatility to my existing equipment as well once I start grinding my own beans (not to mention its way cheaper).",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/xj63jt/recommendation_for_buying_brewing_equipment_aero/

Here’s how I’m preparing the coffee:

I’ve been using 16g of coffee beans, ground using timemore c2 at 14 clicks, 200 Ml of water slightly below boiling temp (using a basic kettle so just eyeballing the temps). Using the inverted method, I’m agitating the coffee for 10s, let it rest for 80s and a 30s press till the bubbles start hissing.

I’m currently drinking RAGE instant coffee (vitamin infused).

I started out with drinking Nescafé instant coffee mixes. But the milk and sugar didn’t go well with me. It also gave me palpitations. I used to mix a sachet of ID filter coffee liquid to give it an extra kick.

I then moved onto sleepy owl, hot and cold brews, black without sugar and milk. It was smoother than Nescafé and the buzz was good. But it still was too much for my stomach to digest. 

I’m currently drinking Rage Instant coffee. It’s the smoothest of all the three brands. And it sits well with my stomach. It’s also convenient to make. 

However, I want to move onto better options. Can you please suggest me how to upgrade my coffee experience?

2. What coffee powder/beans should I buy?

 I was moved to discover that coffee could be so different,  so delicious and so better than instant. Since then I have been enjoying blue tokia's coffee on a regular basis, until I let greed get the better of me. Good coffee was expensive and I was getting cocky, scoured the internet and found a few reddit posts the pointed me in the direction of devan's and bayar's. From what I read, it was good coffee and was light on the wallet. I did my research well and was waiting to taste my rewards.

The day was finally here, been waiting for a week. Got my packet of Devan's Mysore nuggets and Bayar's Excelsia espresso beans, ground them up for channi and waiting for the brew to cool down. I was excited as this coffee is going to taste good, only to find my reward had turned to ash in my mouth, literally ashy, wood like and bitter, bitter, bitter. 

Now appalled by my mistake, I do not wish such ignorance on my worst enemy.  So I would like to convey this experience to those newbies who wish to take a plunge into the world of coffee.

Initially it was always with milk and there were no problems but since 6 months I'm drinking it entirely black (and loving it). The only problem is I now get acid reflux almost every day.

The feeling of acid reflux is such that the lower part of my throat acts irritated and burns a bit and that goes to the lower part of the ears as well. I know this is because of black coffee because prior to drinking it black I never had this problem.

Googled and found out that coffee is relatively highly acidic and it can cause heartburn to people who are easily affected by it. I've ordered litmus pH paper so that I can check how acidic my cuppa coffee is and then compare it with cold brew to see if it's less acidic.

If I blow on it, it goes everywhere and presumably the moisture from my breath would make things stick more. Disassembly is too much for everyday use and timemore recommend against it anyway.

I drink black coffee. Till yesterday, I would just brew it (Kaldipress), and drink after pouring it over a cube of ice. Today I did the same, but changed one thing.

The coffee tastes more well rounded and less bitter. Its as if all sharp tastes have disappeared. The acidity has also become easily perceived. Its not increased, but easily felt now.

This method uses a ""bloom"" coupled with kinetic brewing (aka 'stirring' lol) and aeration (credits to u/abhishyam2007). The temperature used is also lower than the standard 95 - 100C used.

**Profile:**

* Ratio: 16:1 - 13:1
* Roast: Medium
* Grind: Medium / Medium Coarse
* Water Temp: barely simmering (85 - 90C)
* Inverted AeroPress 

**Method:**

1. Pour 1 quarter of water to get coffee grounds wet.
2. Stir gently, about three times.
3. About 30s after first pour started, pour remaining 3 quarters of water, over about 20s.
4. Wait a little while (about 10s) before stirring gently thrice.
5. Push down carefully to make air escape
6. Close AP
7. Invert it back to normal position
8. Wait 2 - 4 mins (based on personal preference)
9. Push firmly to get liquid out as fast as possible. (Usually about 15 20s)
10. Pour coffee to another cup, back and forth to aerate and slightly cool down coffee. (Other aeration methods also work).

This was also a problem with their assorted easy pour bags. Recently had the bottled Bonomi classic cold brew and it made me gag from the sourness. It's made to last for 3 months so I understand that the lack of freshness will definitely be bothersome and not ideal. But don't understand where the acidity comes from.

The coffee was delivered on the 17th of October and since it came, I've tried everything I could to get a decent cup but it just isn't working. The decoction takes a long time to come into the top chamber of the moka pot, always preceded by steam. The coffee is always burnt. Upon inspection, I can see channeling or large ""bypass voids"" in the puck every time.

I think that the coffee is ground way too fine for a moka pot and the puck seems to show evidence of this as the bottom looks like a fine mud. The coffees from Blue Tokai and Corridor 7 never showed this. 

And yes, I do use a scale to measure the coffee and water and aim for a 1:10 coffee to water ratio. I use a small skillet beneath the moka pot for proper heat distribution.

There were no distinct tasting notes that I could find. The body was light but not hollow. There was zero bitterness. There was a good amount of fruitiness. Slight amount of acidity. The striking thing about this coffee is that, it is so damn balanced. I was expecting a punch in the face of fruitness and acidity, as is often the case with most high end coffee. But this was surprisingly complex. The flavour was kind of like mixing lots of fruits together. Yes you can't distingush the fruits but there is a clear profile at the end of it. Absolutely nothing in this coffee is out of place. The entire coffee works as one.   


The only negative thing I have to say about this coffee is it's price. It costs 850rs for 250g. In my humble opinion, that is slightly absurd. Yes the coffee is amazing, but is it 850 bucks amazing?

This is the first dark roast I'm trying, so I decided to try out different recipes, with my Aeropress inverted.

The first cup came out delicious and I absolutely enjoyed it- had the expected bittersweet and dark chocolate taste to it. Used 10g of coffee with \~250ml of water. 

This is my usual recipe, which goes something like this:  
1) Add 10g of coffee to \~30 ml of water at 100 degrees.

2) Stir for 30 seconds.

3) Add water to brim.

4) Add cap, wait for 2 minutes, then invert and press.

As I said, this worked well for me and I enjoyed the coffee.

For the second cup, I used 15g with \~200 ml of water, which is closer the recipe Blue Tokai shares on their website (image attached). It was too bitter and very unpleasant for my taste.

Due to being the de facto hand grinder recommendation in this sub, I'm sure a lot of people have the timemore c2. As such, I think it might be helpful to have a single place with data on what numbers people usually grind at for a given method. Might be applicable to other timemore grinders too as they seem to have the same burr configurations, but not certain on that.

I'm sure it goes without saying, but the clicks are counted after tightening the click wheel clockwise as far as it will go and then counting the number of clicks going counter-clockwise from there. Try to do this on a cleaned grinder or the debris from previous grinds might change the point you start counting from. Also, the handle needs to be attached to the shaft while doing any of this or the click wheel will just move freely without making the adjustments. Obvious things, but no harm in repeating. 

As with most things coffee, the list of variables is endless, so this is more of an exercise in what broadly works for you. Of course, you are free to be as granular as you want with regard to roast levels, type of coffee, preferences regarding ""body"" in a cup of coffee, etc.  and how these change what number you grind at for a given brew method. 

I'll start:

* Moka pot: 12-16

With Toffee, it was not bad, just nothing extraordinary. For third wave I really like that they add the roast date as well to the bags which is really good and with Ainmane, the coffee is probably the best one I've tried so far, especially if you use a Moka Pot.

I keep on trying different brands and before coming to Bangalore I used to live in a small town where a lot of people did not deliver or took too long to deliver and hence I had to rely on options available on Amazon.

u/Un13roken,Kaldi Press - A thorough review.,25,2022-11-19 11:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/yz4iqp/kaldi_press_a_thorough_review/,"Browsing through amazon for my next coffee experiment, I'd come across Kaldi Press, a product that was claiming to be almost exactly the Aeropress at half the price and more value.

Now this caught my attention. Because I had long wondered, about the simplicity of the Aeropress and how much it costs. (I do appreciate my Aeropress, and Alan Adler did one heck of a service to the coffee community). Out of curiousity, I decided to order one for my self, and two days later, I was staring at my Kaldi Press.

Now, the name itself is, just like the product, a very non-original take. Kaldi - or Khalid, is a reference to the first guy who came across coffee, and has been historically a common name, that was used for Coffee chains etc. Kaldi Press, is a pretty no brainer, as far as naming goes. 

Opening the box, you have all your usual suspects, the press itself, 500 filter papers (as opposed to 350 in the Aeropress), a scoop, funnel, stirrer, and surprise-surprise an extra metal filter. But the design of the khaldi Press is identical in almost every aspect to that of the Aeropress, infact the impression that I got from my handling of it, was it almost looked like, a factory second. Why second ? there are dust marks, and poorly done mould cutout marks, that tamper the experience. Nothing that compromises the function, but, still, reminding you of the fact that it is not an Aeropress.

The quality of plastic on the press itself, looked fine, but I have my concerns on the plastic quality of the attachments, the filter chamber, the scoop and stirrer. They don't seem to be made of Polypropylene, but some other plastic but its hard to tell - and this is my first issue with the Kaldi Press - there are no markings on any of the equipment telling you what plastic is being used. Literally, nothing. BPA free is stamped on the box, but that's about it. Nowhere on the box, of the 'manual' in the box. So, I can't say that any particular plastic is being used by what's on the box.

Anyways, after giving it a thorough clean, to get rid of the flecks of industrial dust, I was ready to brew, I did not do the inverted method, as recommended by the Kaldi Press box / booklet as I'm not a fan of risking spilling hot water to a loose plunger, on an unknown press. So, got my fine ground beans, and 80 degrees water, and was ready to go. The entire brewing process and the experience, if identical to the Aeropress, the plunger, goes in at about .2 - .3bars or pressure (my preference for a light, complex profile), and I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the coffee was, despite, me using whats almost an espresso level grind, for maximum extraction. I did remove the metal filter prefitted onto the press, to make sure I get an AB test experience to the Aeropress.

Color me impressed, Kaldi Press is legit, and atleast out of the box, it works as advertised. So, if you are looking for an Aeropress on a budget, that's the end of the review, and you can go ahead and get one.

But this got me to a more interesting discussion, the elephant in the room. Kaldi press is an unashamed rip-off, it even uses the same color combinations as the now Aeropress red and grey. 

Now, lets look at the people, behind Kaldi Press, (I'm new to this sub, so I don't now if I can share my research on the background of the people involved, or if its against the sub rules). Kaldi Press, indeed looks like a family run operation, and the people reported as directors also have 2 other companies registered on them, Cookwell Appliances, and Shelu Reality, so it doesn't look like, its a small family owned business, but more along the lines of one of the businesses by an enterprising businessman.

What dissapoints me about the Kaldi Press is that, there have been no attempts to improve upon the product in anyway. None. Adding a metal filter and suppling us with 150 extra papers is the only difference between the Aeropress and the Kaldi Press (functionally). I also suspect, that the filters and the metal filter are possibly sourced from China (based on my rudimentary search from Chinese suppliers) even if the press itself is made in India. I say its made in India just because it says so, repeatedly on the Kaldi Press, in large bold writing. But I wouldn't buy this product based on the fact that it is made in India. Just because there is nothing to be proud of about the fact that we have basically replicated an existing design without improving it anyway, or at the very least branding it in any other way.

While I will not venture into the area of legality of copying IP, I will say, I am dissapointed that, the design was not improved upon, in any way. However, when it comes to coffee we should note that, the entire industry runs on an ethically flimsy argument, we wouldn't have affordable coffee without, what is essentially, slave labor, in plantations across the world.

Should you buy the Kaldi Press ? 

Functionally, its identical to the Aeropress, and as far as value for money goes, its better than the Aeropress. Ethics are for you to decide, and I've tried to lay out all the facts for you to make that judgement. I applaud Kaldi Brew (The company behind Kaldi Press) for bringing the simplicity of the Aeropress to a wider market, and allowing people to experience the magic of the Aeropress. One of the advantages of copying a design so sincerely, is that, most recipes and videos on Aeropress will apply to the Kaldi Press. HOWEVER, as a designer myself, I am dissapointed by the fact that no effort was done, to improve upon the design in any way. I would've like to see a reason for why the 'made in india' line, stamped on the Kaldi press should invoke any sense of pride in me. For now, it is more a source of shame, rather than pride.

Other Aeropress knock off's - The Kaldi Press, feels identical to a chinese product that goes by the name of Pressure Press. I'm not sure, if they are related considering both of the copy the Aeropress' design, but curiously, it comes with a metal filter, and is completely unbranded. And retails for around INR 1000. And has similar defects, to the Kaldi press, in terms of refinement, as reported online. 

A couple of suggestions to the guys behind the product -

1. Please consider improving on the design of the product, there, still are a lot of variables, in the Aeropress equation, that can be tweaked for improvement, and then, we can proudly, put the 'made in india' label on it.
2. Specify the type of plastic used on the box, I would've loved to see any certification on its food safety standards on the box.
3. Curiously, the warranty card (12months), states, the warranty is not applicable unless signed, and when ordered on Amazon, the card was NOT signed. This is confusing.

Or should I go for some other equipment like the AeroPress?

Should I 
1) Return the C2 and get a C3?
2) Keep the C2 for now and upgrade to a 1zpresso/comandante later?

1) When we say a coffee/brew is sweet - is it referring to the absence of bitterness or is it an actual perception of a sweet taste we are referring to?

2) When we say a cup is balanced - does it mean there’s absolutely no bitterness to it, or does it mean that acid vs bitterness are sort of balanced out? When James Hoffman or others refer to ‘the bitter wall’ that occurs because of grinding too fine - is that referring to the appearance of bitterness as we grind finer and finer or is it referring to it being bitter to the point of not being able to taste anything else? 

I’ve never had specialty coffee from a proper cafe, and that might not happen anytime soon because of my current work situation - so I have no point of reference. 

I recently got a Timemore C2 and Hario Switch and a bag of medium roasted coffee and have been playing around with grind size - I’ve had cups that tasted sour but still had quite apparent bitterness, and I’ve had cups that had some bitterness but tasted flat otherwise. Grind size has ranged from 14-20 but I haven’t been able to zero in on a single best cup. 

I generally brew 15 gms to 250 ml, bloom with about 45-50ml for 45 seconds, pour the rest of the water in, let it steep up to total brew time hits 2:15, give it a small stir - wait for 30 seconds and then let it draw down. Draw down takes about 45 ish seconds generally (total brew time in the 3:30 -3:50 range)",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/zbhcov/need_help_dialing_in_grind_size_for_c2_switch/

I want to get into coffee but I've no clue how to start. I've only had milk based instant coffee (loaded with sugar) till now :/ 
And everything just seems a lil too complicated. 

What should I start with? A south indian filter or an aeropress? Obviously not restricted but I've these two in mind currently. 

I've also seen people emphasising the importance of freshly grinding the coffee beans but i guess I'll start with pre ground coffee for now and will invest in Timemore C2 (because that's the most talked about and is affordable lol) probably after some point of time. 

I've seen some people say that aeropress can pretty much do what a south indian filter can plus many more things! But apparently some people prefer south indian filter over aeropress for MILK BASED COFFEE. I understand it all boils down to personal preference at the end of the day but what's your take on it? 

Additionally, should i be getting a French press for preparing textured milk for my coffee? 

Lastly, If you recommend getting a south indian filter to start with, please drop recommendations too for it. Idk what size should i be getting and what size of the holes is appropriate. I wish there was some standardization to make it more convenient. SOFI 72 from aramse seems to be nice but is very expensive.  Is the blue tokai one a good choice if anyone has tried? It seems to be well priced at 450rs.

I conducted a little experiment at home with my south Indian filter 

Ground coffee used :- devan's monsooned Malabar Arabic AA (SIF grind) medium roast
 
it claims that it has sweetish finish and  guess what it has.

preferred as black coffee without any additional sweetner

1st day:-

Coffee to water ratio :- 1:6

Taken 15g coffee to 90ml water ( boiled let it sit for 1:30 minute to bring temp around 90 to 95 celcius)

Bloomed it with 50 ml water with 45 second rest.

Now after 10 to 15 minutes got decoction

Coffee decoction to hot water ratio :- tried with two ratios 1:4 and 1:6
 (20 g to 80g and 20g to 120g water, done weighing with pocket scale)

Conclusion:- 1:4 was bitter than 1:6 and no that great aftertaste in either of them

It's allover bitter taste 

2nd day:- 

Coffee to water ratio:- 1:5

Same above process

Coffee decoction to water ratio:- 1:4 and 1:6

Now with 1:6 ratio it has great taste but no that strong sweet aftertaste it like mild mouthfill of sweetness

But with 1:4 ratio I find it very delicious, with balanced taste with medium acidity and very  
Sweet aftertaste that linger much longer in mouth 

3rd day:- 

C to w ratio :-1:4

Same process above
  
I have  input of 60 ml and got output of 35 ml of decoction

Decoction to water ratio:- 1:4 and used all decoction as it's not that much to have 1:6

I don't like the taste of this, it feels under extracted and it has no aftertaste what's so ever, it was crap

TL;DR:- GO WITH COFFEE TO WATER RATIO OF 1:5
THEN DECOCTION TO WATER RATIO OF 1:4 
And you will have a great cup of black coffee

**Pictures:**

[Ground beans at 15 clicks on timemore c2](https://i.imgur.com/atsaGYY.jpg)

[Ground beans in pourover filter paper](https://i.imgur.com/OYJl7o3.jpg)



**Method and materials:**

Timemore C2 set at 15 clicks

Espro bloom pourover with espro filter paper (didn't preheat this time)

Recipe:

* 25g coffee: 400g water
* Water at 100°C
* 30 second bloom with 50 g water
* ~25 gram swirls of water with ~8 second intervals in between making sure the bed of coffee doesn't go dry
* Total draw time ~2 minute 40 seconds


**Tasting notes:**

(Bear in mind this is highly subjective and it's based on the first cup I have brewed of this coffee. Don't treat this as a recommendation one way or the other.)

The smell from the brewed cup is a bit grassy and earthy. Not entirely unappealing though.

The first tasting notes I got were sweet and spicy with kind of a peanut like taste. It is a very distinct kind of sweetness, and pairs very well with the mellow acidity. There is a wine like fruity dryness to the aftertaste. I like it a lot overall.

Expecting this to do well on the moka pot.

January 2021 was when I ditched nescafe, levista, davidoff and started to brew my own coffee. Started off with a French press and started buying ground powder from Cothas, Jayanthi etc. After a few months, went beyond these 2 brands and started buying from some famous roasters such as Blue Tokai, Third Wave, and Devans. Then I slowly shifted to whole bean coffee and I was trying out many roasters, I thought ill just make a list in 2022 featuring the different coffees purchased, and information on price, estate, processes and giving a rating to each.

So the following are the top 5 best coffees I have had in 2022:

1. NAGALAND ZUNHEBOTO HONEY, Grey Soul
2. Grand Reserve, ARAKU
3. Ratnagiri estate lot H26, QBF
4. Howdia Estate, Blue Tokai
5. Let there be light, Kapi kotai

Also, shoutout to the 35g of Ratnagiri red fruit fermentation - part of the producer lot 5 by BT, I really hope they sell a 250g bag of it in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Other stats:

Total money spent on coffee (Jan - Dec): Rs 12,482

Total grams consumed: 6,245g

Total roasters tried: 19 (All Indian)

&amp;#x200B;

Most of these have been brewed in a french press, Aeropress and the Hario switch. Grinder: Timemore C2.

Finally, Im excited for 2023 to try out new coffees and roasters and recipes.

**Here are the pictures:**

[Exterior packaging](https://i.imgur.com/LAcpdiF.jpg)

[Coffee beans](https://i.imgur.com/IoS0DTx.jpg)

[Ground beans(14 clicks on timemore c2)](https://i.imgur.com/dGTGB8w.jpg)


**Methods and materials:**

Same as in the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/zotreb/unboxing_of_nagaland_mon_naturals_light_roast_by/), but 14 clocks on the grinder this time, and the pourover was pre heated. The total draw time was a bit different too at about 2 minutes 55 seconds.


**Tasting notes:**

(Tasting notes disclaimer from [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/zotreb/unboxing_of_nagaland_mon_naturals_light_roast_by/) applies)

(Also bear in mind that I bought this coffee at the beginning of the month so that could also have an influence here too)

Smell of the brewed coffee has a mildly sweet undercurrent but is mostly earthy in aroma.

The taste at first sip is kind if like a sensory overload of flavours all at once. The predominant note to me is a citrus like bitterness, then a candy like fruity, acidic sweetness. The aftertaste is a kind of bittersweet feeling that you get after drinking orange juice. It's a very pleasant coffee but this type of sweetness isn't really for me. But I guess that's my bias against honey processed coffees in general.

u/NotRealHyde,Fraction9: Full disclosure and What to expect.,9,2023-01-07 14:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/105k6pz/fraction9_full_disclosure_and_what_to_expect/,"Recently fraction9 launched 2 new single estate speciality coffee, starting at amazing prices. However the coffee has been worse than expected. After talking through things with them, I've been informed about the following. Also, props to their customer support.

&gt;Actually these lots are being launched at zero profit margin. A step tht we have taken to contribute to Indian speciality coffee in some way. But beans are not compromised and Infact bought at same price as other Roasters.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why does my coffee look unevenly roasted and chaff-filled (naturals)?**

If you check other roasters, all naturals have an uneven looking roast due to the inherent processing. This is a feature not a bug. However, due to reasons mentioned below they went for a darker roast than ideal, this lead to the uneven look, seeming worse.

They will make sure that chaff isn't present in the future roasts. Personally I'd cut them some slack because this is their first time (to my knowledge) working with natural processing.

&amp;#x200B;

**What went wrong with it's flavour profile?**

They tried to cater to both milk and non milk coffee drinkers. This lead to muted acidity and increased bitterness than us black coffee drinkers have come to expect and like. They have confirmed that this will not be happening in the future.

&gt;In future  We will design roast profiles specifically for black coffee and with not more than light roast (or medium minus)

&amp;#x200B;

**What about future roasts?**

&gt;Will launch one premium specialty coffee each month *(at 60% OFF) and lower roast profiles only*

Do note that I am neither paid, nor do I represent them. This post is to make aware other buyers who've bought their coffee on my recommendation, about what they've told me. Personally I'm expecting them to release amazing roasts in the future. Cheers to good coffee!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/105k6pz/fraction9_full_disclosure_and_what_to_expect/

**Tasting notes:**

(Tasting notes disclaimer from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/zotreb/unboxing_of_nagaland_mon_naturals_light_roast_by/) applies)


Smell of the brewed coffee has an earthy, ashy nuttiness.

The taste at first sip is just burnt bitterness with a very very mild hint of some sort of chocolaty, nutty acidity in the background. The burnt taste lingers overwhelmingly for a long time with each sip, burying anything else that might be there. On some sips, if the wall of bitterness relents for a bit, you can get some melon like fruity flavour. But it's so fleeting that it's possible that my buyer's remorse is making me hallucinate it.

It's certainly not even in the top 10 worst coffees I've ever tasted, but it's been years since I've had a cup this bad. Not undrinkable to the levels of some other roasters I've tried in the past but not a good first(and probably last) impression from a roaster.

u/NotRealHyde,Coffee Megathread,14,2023-01-11 13:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/108zcp1/coffee_megathread/,"This guide is meant for anyone from India who is new to speciality coffee. Equipment, methods and coffee roasters and roasts will be discussed here.

# Equipment:

1. South Indian Filter (\~250): The SIF we all know and love.
2. French Press (500 \~ 1.5k): Most affordable way to get started. Can brew good black coffee and drinkable milk coffee as well. Also serves as a cheap alternative to a milk frother. Recommended if you just want to try some specialty coffee.
3. AeroPress (&lt;3k): Most versatile and convenient coffee equipment. Can brew amazing black coffee (especially medium roasts) and ok milk coffee. Suitable for new users and aficionados alike. Recommended if you just want good coffee with the least amount of effort.
4. v60 (1.5k \~ 2.5k): Most nuanced coffee equipment. Can make amazing and complex black coffee (especially light roasts). Requires a bit of technique and skill. Can make drinkable milk coffee. Recommended for enthusiasts who want to learn and brew a nuanced cup of coffee.
5. Moka Pot(2k\~6k): Can make amazing milk coffee and drinkable americano. A little finicky to work with. Recommended for milk coffee drinkers who don’t want to buy an espresso machine.
6. Espresso Machine

There are other niche hybrid equipment that are used. However they have been left out to simplify the list.

# Buying Coffee:

You can buy coffee online from any “standard” roaster in India. Almost all of them will deliver to you within a few days from roasting, free of additional charge, with “roast date” mentioned so you can be assured of its freshness. Buying whole beans and grinding them is ideal but if you don’t want to invest in a grinder, buying smaller quantities of pre-ground coffee will do. Grinders can become very expensive very quick. If you live close to a cafe, it is worthwhile to buy a bag of whole beans online and ask them to grind it for you.

1. First time buying speciality coffee: It is highly recommended you get a coffee sampler pack from a standard roaster. Ideally you’d want to pick a light, medium and dark roast each. Brew each to get an idea of what you like. Here are some roasters you can buy sampler packs from: bluetokai(customisable), something’s brewing explorer box. Almost every major roaster offers their samplers. however these are the few recommended so far.
2. You know what you like: Lurk in the sub for a while and see which roaster is being talked about, then buy a roast you like from said roaster. Some relevant links are a [list of coffee roasters in India](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BGfdUIoFXojglhvRRJeHo6ZMiHiEGMarNd3A8aIPHNs/edit#gid=0) and [which roasters I buy from most often](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS-IbLFVERmHKPlDKs4pNJsxzmf92AxE4hXmIj0XqOetKYTVjnnjJ-1KkWOSmxbt_FOIorQZKL559PF/pubchart?oid=638659970&amp;format=interactive).
3. You want to explore new coffee: Find new coffee being talked about on the sub. Buy different “processing”, “fermentation”, “estate”, and “varietal” than what you normally get. It is recommended to understand these terms well enough before. More information on how to achieve just that will be discussed below. You might also want to venture into buying foreign coffee despite a price premium.

# Understanding Coffee:

1. Coffee processing is just as important as roast level. Here is a [glossary of processing terms](https://christopherferan.com/2022/08/19/a-sort-of-glossary-of-coffee-processes/).
2. World Barista Championship 2007 winner and youtube’s resident coffee guy [James Hoffman](https://www.youtube.com/@jameshoffmann). He has a youtube video on just about anything you’d need to know about coffee (do note, a lot of his advice and brewing methods aren’t specialised for Indian coffee).
3. A place for coffee geeks to chat [India CBC Discord](https://discord.gg/eKcnGu2P7U) (do note, this discord server isn’t affiliated with this subreddit).

# Brewing Methods:

Different coffee equipment has it’s own pros and cons. Admittedly there is a bit of a difficulty curve present. However trying out different methods, understanding them, and ultimately trying to come up with a brew thats suited for you is what makes speciality coffee such a fun activity. There are an endless number of brews possible with almost every method, but it is recommended for newer brewers to master about 2 different methods per equipment. This will allow you comparatively understand differences created by said method.

1. French Press: James Hoffman Standard
2. v60: James Hoffman Standard, Tetsu Kasuya’s 4:6 and hybrid.
3. AeroPress: James Hoffman Standard, [Quarter First](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/y24ugr/aeropress_made_juicier_and_sweeter_the_quater/), [and much more](https://aeroprecipe.com/)
4. Moka Pot: James Hoffman Standard, European Coffee Trip.

Note: This post will keep being updated with more resources and answers to common questions. This endeavour is to try to make speciality coffee as accessible as possible and get rid of the “gatekeeping” stereotype around this hobby.

But recently I bought the Rwanda Shyira and Kenyan peaberry from CL and with both batches I had the same problem - excessive chaff and with almost every single brew with the V60 the paper filter used to get clogged and I would inevitably get stalled and channeled brews (they didn't taste bad per se, but I'd get this odd feeling that it was simultaneously both under and overextracted).  I had a Hario skerton so I initially chalked it up to grinder problems and bought a 1zpresso JMax but I've encountered the same issues again. What can I do?

Have been so for the past couple of months. Always wanted to own an Espresso Machine as I enjoy them often( and tbh thought it’d be pretty cool to show it off🤣🤣🤣) 

I bought the Brikka to test out whether I could find the time every morning to actually make that cup of coffee. I am a very lazy person but when it comes to something I love I get very invested. 

I only drank proper coffee once or twice weekly before. I used to just microwave water and then put coffee powder in to make coffee as I wanted to save time. 

But now I’ve established a routine for the coffee making process. I make time to enjoy that cup of coffee in the morning. I might not be a coffee connoisseur or anything but I love my coffee. Just plain Black Coffee.

Right now I’m thinking of making the jump and buying an Espresso Machine. I have a budget in mind of 50k max but preferably in the 30k range. I was thinking of getting the Gaggia Classic Pro and a Timemore Chestnut combo firstly and then upgrading parts along the way. Is there any other combo you guys would suggest? I never thought grinders would be this expensive. Please do guide me through the rest of my journey.

Now I wanna make make some next level coffee but with lattes that I've tried at shops are really weird for my taste. For me the best case scenario is to make a 60ml concentrated coffee shot and add it to my sweetened unforthed whole milk cup to get that next level experience rather than adding instant coffee

What is the best way for this? Hoffman said grind your own coffee beans so should I get a manual grinder, and then Hoffman also had a video about using an inverted Aeropress to make an espresso, so should I use that or a cheap espresso machine?

For first couple of years they had fresh nicely roasted coffee beans and the staff ( atleast at their Koramangala outlet ) were expert baristas brewing pretty good cups of coffee. The founder was also pretty approachable and seemed passionate about coffee, it was always fun chatting with him and learning about the trade.

None of that is true about them anymore. To me it fails on two fronts now

1. The consistency and quality of their coffee beans has dropped. My last 3 batches have been overroasted and don't feel as fresh as compared to early days

2. Staff is woefully under trained. I am always slightly amused as they warn me than french press is black coffee and will be very bitter. I also helplessly watch as they overbrew a frenchpress and give me a cup of over extracted coffee tasting water. 

There is a TWC outlets in every corner of blr( VC money maybe? ) now but the coffee is only marginally better than other cafes. I am  cautious of ordering a black coffee at any of their own outlets, it is disappointing because they are ubiquitous and having a reliable coffee chain would have been glorious",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/10p2cs6/does_anyone_think_of_third_wave_coffee_roasters/

I have been brewing coffee using the pour over method. This is the filter that I'm using - https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08W8HX4H8?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

I fill about 80% of this filter with ground coffee (Ikkis light roast or Sleepy Owl Hazelnut flavour). With this I brew 240ml of coffee approximately.
I bring water to a boil, then pour it over the filter. After that I leave the stove on simmer(low heat), and keep pouring water over the grounds once I feel the previous batch of water has run through the filter entirely

By the time I'm done with brewing the coffee, it becomes cool, and it takes a lot of time to brew (more than 5 minutes). I like my coffee boiling hot if possible.

So, am I brewing it wrong? Or is my coffee/water ratio wrong? Or am I just making too much coffee at one go?

Also, is there a low fuss way to brew coffee, without spending more than a few minutes and not spending much on equipment? I tend to like light roasts, if that helps with deciding a brewing method",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/10rq41x/coffee_takes_too_long_to_brew_and_becomes_cold/

Pre-heated FP.. used 1000:60 ratio.. heated water before boil poured them on FP and just placed the plunger to its surface.. waited for 5 minutes and used a chai channi without using plunger and pouring all at once in channi.. I know there will be silt and but it settled down and used to have a less water-ish coffee that way.. but overall taste was very bad.. and very acidic type.. don't know if I am correct as I have directly tried specially coffee for the first time.. and I am saying with what I can comprehend..

Then I just replaced water will whole fat milk and a very little sugar and have started to love it.. after Unakki roast now I am drinking Stanmore roast and that very good.. feels like a bit nutty or chocolatey.. I don't know notes since it has only been a month.. but I think everyone in this community will suggest me to drink black as it's more original way to taste the coffee.. so I am ready to try black ones but if it taste good.

Firstly, I was a tad disappointed by the appearance of the beans. They seemed too tiny (:D). They also didn't seem to have the aroma that you instantly get from a great bag of freshly roasted beans.

V60 supported by clips on a utensil with slightly larger mouth than v60.

300 ml water over 15 seconds with 1:30 draw down time.

I ordered french press grind for older method, but the grind seems to be too fine than that, so I am using newer method.

I have stored the grounds in the freezer(although the coffee bag's seal seems to have weakened over the course of the few days)

TLDR at the bottom.

So,  after using the timemore c2, for a while now, I was getting real tired  of grinding my coffee in the morning, its a habit that I had picked up  during the pandemic, and the extra time made it a comfortable and  pleasurable thing to do every morning, but life caught on, and I could  dedicate lesser time to it, and would just rush through it, and began  finding it like a chore. That's when I wanted to get myself an electric  version.

My initial idea was to  design a motor housing that would do the grinding for me, I work with  designing products, and I thought I could just design and get one  prototyped pretty easily. But then again, that excitement died out quite  quickly, when I realized, what a jugaad of an experience that was going  to be in the short term, so I just casually browsed if any of the  Chinese had already done this.

And lo and behold, they had, and infact, they did a better job in design than I could've.

[This generic coffee grinder](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004060065687.html?algo_pvid=63be9ad0-23a0-4f0c-9d33-248fa6485914&amp;algo_exp_id=63be9ad0-23a0-4f0c-9d33-248fa6485914-1&amp;pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000027898237414%22%7D&amp;pdp_npi=2%40dis%21INR%213075.75%211537.87%21%21%21%21%21%402122457116753148773762477d0666%2112000027898237414%21sea&amp;curPageLogUid=dLJQndNDiLhD)  was exactly what I was looking for, 1.5k, USB C, transparent bottom,  ceramic burr grinders, adjustable. But yeah, I wasn't going to wait for a  month and hope they aren't lost to customs.

So, I looked at if any of our 'Indian' brands were doing businessman things and came across [Instacuppa](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004060065687.html?algo_pvid=63be9ad0-23a0-4f0c-9d33-248fa6485914&amp;algo_exp_id=63be9ad0-23a0-4f0c-9d33-248fa6485914-1&amp;pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000027898237414%22%7D&amp;pdp_npi=2%40dis%21INR%213075.75%211537.87%21%21%21%21%21%402122457116753148773762477d0666%2112000027898237414%21sea&amp;curPageLogUid=dLJQndNDiLhD),  I was already familiar with this brand, I was using their coffee mug  and waterbottle, and both of them were good. So I went ahead and ordered  one, it costed an extra 1k, after landing on our shores and being  stamped with Instacuppas logo on it.

Now to those unfamiliar, both of these products, if I can even call them as two different products, are inspired by the [Timemore Go](https://www.amazon.in/TIMEMORE-Grinder-Portable-Electric-Conical/dp/B0963NHFL9).  And the Timemore Go, itself had gotten some pretty good reviews, but  its not available here, so this is the closest we get to over here.

I  received my package in a day, and it came in a box, that still had  chinese branding on it. Opening it, there was a manual, no branding,  just a generic manual, that did a competent job of explaining the  device. A brush to clean the burrs, and a USB C cable.

I expected it to be a 'passable' experience, but I was pleasantly surprised.

So lets break it down.

**Design -**  I'm a sucker for minimalist design, and this was as minimalist as it  gets, a black cylinder, sitting on top of the clear cylinder. I wished  the blue light ring was white or something, but hey, that's just me  nitpicking. The build quality however was just 'OK'. Nothing glaringly  wrong with it, but once you are used to something like the C2, its hard  to top that at 1/6th the price. It felt serviceable. The USB port was  firm, and the bottom coffee collecter had a rubber ring on it, that  meant that it sits firmly and also has an airtight seal. Instacuppa, did  put in some helpful cup markers to indicate how many cups is it  grinding, but I did find them to be wrong and also, something that would  come off in a few washes.

**Performance -**  I tested it out at an medium fine grind, how I prefer my aeropress, and  the result was surprisingly consistent, it takes about 2-3 minutes to  grind out one cups worth coffee. And the best part was that it turns off  on its own once the beans are finished. The grind was surprisingly  consistent, and I suspect its because of how it grinds - your regular  electric grinders tend to be a higher RPM grind, but this was pretty  slow, it was a lot closer to manual grinding. The grind was thorough and  atleast through a sieve, indistinguishable from what my C2 produced. I  was very happy with the result. Most importantly, it was fun to use. You  just put the beans in, and watch it slowly, grind and build in the  bottom container, while you wait for the water to heat up.

**Important things to consider -**

1. You  cannot use the grinder while its being charged, so if you ran out of  battery, you will need to wait for it to be charged, and this can be  very annoying. I'm someone who uses a phone, laptop, tablet, wireless  earbuds, a battery pack and a smartwatch. So I tend to have a schedule  for charging things, and this one sits along with those now, instead of  the kitchen. So its usually plugged in.
2. Its worth noting that you get about 10-15 cups before needing to be charged again.
3. Can grind about 30g at one go, so about 2-3 cups of how I'd like to make my coffee. YMMV.
4. It takes about 3 hours to charge the thing, looks like a Li-ion battery, so its nice to see that they haven't cheaped out there.
5. Can  take in a wide variety of USB C input, I tried it with my 60w charger,  and my 15w phone charger, both of them have the same results, so better  to use the 15w charger.
6. The  bottom container is not made of glass, this bothers me a bit. Its  actually a material closer to acrylic. And anyone who works with it  already knows, that acrylic scratches easy. I'm not too worried about  the food safety aspect, as its meant to handle only dry room temperature  material, but I'd have gladly paid extra for a glass container.
7. The  adjustments that can be made are a pretty solid, its not stepless  though, now depending on how much control you like, that's a positive or  a negative.
8. The  ceramic burrs are easily cleanable, and retain very little in the  container, looks like about 0.3 grams is stuck in the burrs, so keep  that in mind, when you are changing coffee, consider girding a tiny  amount to flush out your previous bean.
9. This  device has been known to have issues with the sensor malfunctioning,  where the device switches off, even if there's coffee beans still left  to grind. The OEM addressed this by giving a manual override, where you  press the button for 3 seconds and it will grind for 3 minutes. I find  this to be an acceptable solution. But for what its worth, it worked  flawlessly for me.
10. Because  this device is based on a battery, it comes with a built in expiry date  - say 2 years from now, the battery capacity falls to 50% or its output  drops, this device will become just e-waste. They should've really  designed it to run while connected and bypass the battery altogether.  That feels like a big oversight.
11. The  upside to it being battery powered however is that its perfect to use  when outside and you want to enjoy making a fresh cup out while camping  or in a picnic, infact, my appreciation for the product was when I was  out on and early morning picnic and had the chance to make coffee for  someone. I could skip the awkward manual grind, and have a pleasant  experience while conversing and the water heating up on a camp stove.

Now  as to the company itself - For some reason, Instacuppa, too like Kaldi,  are selling themselves like a small family owned business, Infact,  there's a small card, where they ask you to give them feedback and  appeal to them as such. This probably is true. But considering their  original statements - [Like products being manufactured exclusively for them, and using natural materials](https://www.indiamart.com/instacuppa-services-opc-pvt-ltd/about-us.html),  I think the brand has outgrown that image considerably, and are today  into importing chinese products and rebranding. nothing wrong with it,  but its worth noting none the less.

TLDR;  The Instacuppa electric grinder is a surprisingly good grinder for  those on a budget, infact, I think it makes home ground coffee a joy to  use, and I think that is just as important, as consuming the coffee  itself. I find the margins they are charging over the chinese OEM's to  be fair, and they do seem to care about their products. So if someone is  on a budget, I can easily recommend it after my own experience.

Cheers and Happy brewing guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/119zee9/instacuppa_electric_grinder_review_i_wasnt/

Test Subject: 1kg (divided into two portions) home blend dark roasted Coffee (ARABICA AAA/ CHERRY AAA) ROASTED DATE:9JAN2023
METHOD: POUR OVER aka Hario V60 , Grinder timemore c3 (clicks 18) 
Water temperature 95°C
Description: I purchased 9jan home blend arabica AAA coffee whole beans, roasted date is also 9jan. 
I divided the coffee beans into two portions, one  portion stored in timemore vacuum canister, another portion of the coffee stored in borosil airtight jar. 
Throughout the month , I use only timemore vaccum canister's coffee, 
After more than 1 .5 months of rest of the borosil airtight jar's coffee, yesterday i opened the  borosil airtight container's coffee and brew it through V60 . [James Hoffmann 1cup method, grinder timemore c3 18 clicks]
The taste of the coffee is bitter, harsh, and has less acidity/ less sourness of fruits then the timemore vacuum canister's one.
My thoughts: Borosil airtight jar doesn't have any kind of degassing system, so it's never degasses, that's why flavour profile has never developed.
Other hand Timemore vacuum canister has degassing system like Fellow vaccum canisters. 
Objective difference of the coffee: borosil airtight's coffee physically looks like dry, less oily then the timemore vaccum canister's coffee beans. 
Also while grinding, coffee particles of the borosil airtight container's coffee never stick to the grinder's clicking base, but timemore 's one always sticks to the grinder's clicking base.

Recently, this subreddit wasn't moderated at its best. The old rules still apply, and roasters/owners are asked to refrain from self-promotion of their brands, even though they are welcome to create brand accounts and not post anything promoting their brands. Instead, they should assist users with any queries in the comments, if they are directly related to their brands.

Using Discord server for promotion/marketing, although I have no control over that server, brands/users are more than welcome to join them. Marketing and promotion are permitted in the indiacbc discord server because they have a channel specifically for that purpose, the sole decision is with the mods of that server. 

Also, a few people were removed not ""banned"" from the subreddit because they had been tricking other users into buying from their cafe/channel/ roastery while posing as regular consumer.

u/Un13roken,"A surprisingly good, cheap, electric grinder review.",12,2023-03-05 19:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/11iy4i8/a_surprisingly_good_cheap_electric_grinder_review/," TLDR at the bottom. 

The [Instacuppa Electric Grinder Review](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B09CRHQKK7?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder-t1_k0_1_24&amp;amp=&amp;crid=RARVMRH90ICA&amp;amp=&amp;sprefix=instacuppa+electric+grin).

So, after using the timemore c2, for a while now, I was getting real tired of grinding my coffee in the morning, its a habit that I had picked up during the pandemic, and the extra time made it a comfortable and pleasurable thing to do every morning, but life caught on, and I could dedicate lesser time to it, and would just rush through it, and began finding it like a chore. That's when I wanted to get myself an electric version. 

My initial idea was to design a motor housing that would do the grinding for me, I work with designing products, and I thought I could just design and get one prototyped pretty easily. But then again, that excitement died out quite quickly, when I realized, what a jugaad of an experience that was going to be in the short term, so I just casually browsed if any of the Chinese had already done this. 

And lo and behold, they had, and infact, they did a better job in design than I could've. 

This generic coffee grinder was exactly what I was looking for, 1.5k, USB C, transparent bottom, ceramic burr grinders, adjustable. But yeah, I wasn't going to wait for a month and hope they aren't lost to customs. 

So, I looked at if any of our 'Indian' brands were doing businessman things and came across Instacuppa, I was already familiar with this brand, I was using their coffee mug and waterbottle, and both of them were good. So I went ahead and ordered one, it costed an extra 1k, after landing on our shores and being stamped with Instacuppas logo on it. 

Now to those unfamiliar, both of these products, if I can even call them as two different products, are inspired by the Timemore Go. And the Timemore Go, itself had gotten some pretty good reviews, but its not available here, so this is the closest we get to over here. 

I received my package in a day, and it came in a box, that still had chinese branding on it. Opening it, there was a manual, no branding, just a generic manual, that did a competent job of explaining the device. A brush to clean the burrs, and a USB C cable. 

I expected it to be a 'passable' experience, but I was pleasantly surprised. 

So lets break it down. 

Design - I'm a sucker for minimalist design, and this was as minimalist as it gets, a black cylinder, sitting on top of the clear cylinder. I wished the blue light ring was white or something, but hey, that's just me nitpicking. The build quality however was just 'OK'. Nothing glaringly wrong with it, but once you are used to something like the C2, its hard to top that at 1/6th the price. It felt serviceable. The USB port was firm, and the bottom coffee collector had a rubber ring on it, that meant that it sits firmly and also has an airtight seal. Instacuppa, did put in some helpful cup markers to indicate how many cups is it grinding, but I did find them to be wrong and also, something that would come off in a few washes. 

Performance - I tested it out at an medium fine grind, how I prefer my aeropress, and the result was surprisingly consistent, it takes about 2-3 minutes to grind out one cups worth coffee. And the best part was that it turns off on its own once the beans are finished. The grind was surprisingly consistent, and I suspect its because of how it grinds - your regular electric grinders tend to be a higher RPM grind, but this was pretty slow, it was a lot closer to manual grinding. The grind was thorough and atleast through a sieve, indistinguishable from what my C2 produced. I was very happy with the result. Most importantly, it was fun to use. You just put the beans in, and watch it slowly, grind and build in the bottom container, while you wait for the water to heat up. 

Important things to consider - 

   You cannot use the grinder while its being charged, so if you ran out of battery, you will need to wait for it to be charged, and this can be very annoying. I'm someone who uses a phone, laptop, tablet, wireless earbuds, a battery pack and a smartwatch. So I tend to have a schedule for charging things, and this one sits along with those now, instead of the kitchen. So its usually plugged in. 

   Its worth noting that you get about 10-15 cups before needing to be charged again. 

   Can grind about 30g at one go, so about 2-3 cups of how I'd like to make my coffee. YMMV. 

   It takes about 3 hours to charge the thing, looks like a Li-ion battery, so its nice to see that they haven't cheaped out there. 

   Can take in a wide variety of USB C input, I tried it with my 60w charger, and my 15w phone charger, both of them have the same results, so better to use the 15w charger. 

   The bottom container is not made of glass, this bothers me a bit. Its actually a material closer to acrylic. And anyone who works with it already knows, that acrylic scratches easy. I'm not too worried about the food safety aspect, as its meant to handle only dry room temperature material, but I'd have gladly paid extra for a glass container. 

   The adjustments that can be made are a pretty solid, its not stepless though, now depending on how much control you like, that's a positive or a negative. 

   The ceramic burrs are easily cleanable, and retain very little in the container, looks like about 0.3 grams is stuck in the burrs, so keep that in mind, when you are changing coffee, consider girding a tiny amount to flush out your previous bean. 

   This device has been known to have issues with the sensor malfunctioning, where the device switches off, even if there's coffee beans still left to grind. The OEM addressed this by giving a manual override, where you press the button for 3 seconds and it will grind for 3 minutes. I find this to be an acceptable solution. But for what its worth, it worked flawlessly for me. 

   Because this device is based on a battery, it comes with a built in expiry date - say 2 years from now, the battery capacity falls to 50% or its output drops, this device will become just e-waste. They should've really designed it to run while connected and bypass the battery altogether. That feels like a big oversight. 

   The upside to it being battery powered however is that its perfect to use when outside and you want to enjoy making a fresh cup out while camping or in a picnic, infact, my appreciation for the product was when I was out on and early morning picnic and had the chance to make coffee for someone. I could skip the awkward manual grind, and have a pleasant experience while conversing and the water heating up on a camp stove. 

Now as to the company itself - For some reason, Instacuppa, too like Kaldi, are selling themselves like a small family owned business, Infact, there's a small card, where they ask you to give them feedback and appeal to them as such. This probably is true. But considering their original statements - Like products being manufactured exclusively for them, and using natural materials, I think the brand has outgrown that image considerably, and are today into importing chinese products and rebranding. nothing wrong with it, but its worth noting none the less. 

TLDR; The Instacuppa electric grinder is a surprisingly good grinder for those on a budget, infact, I think it makes home ground coffee a joy to use, and I think that is just as important, as consuming the coffee itself. I find the margins they are charging over the chinese OEM's to be fair, and they do seem to care about their products. So if someone is on a budget, I can easily recommend it after my own experience. 

Cheers and Happy brewing guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/11iy4i8/a_surprisingly_good_cheap_electric_grinder_review/

The simple reason is that I am sensitive to caffeine and having more than one cup is bad for my anxiety, so I always order americanos, pour overs, Aeropress and cold brews at specialty coffee shops so that I can enjoy them longer, but last weekend I received horribly diluted pour over from a Blue Tokai outlet in Kolkata and wasn’t satisfied so I ordered an espresso of their silver oak blend and I realised how good espressos can be for the first time. TBH I realised I always knew it deep down but was avoiding it so that I can enjoy my V60s and Aeropress at home. Since I live in a lower tier city than Kolkata there are no specialty coffee shops around and all I can think about is Espresso. I’m going crazy with craving! It’s not like V60 isn’t flavorful if not more then at least it’s as flavorful as espresso but the concentrated blast of flavors that I got from that first sip was to die for! Thank you for coming to my rant.

The idea here is to eliminate unwanted components of a particular ""bad"" coffee while doubling down on its pleasant characteristics and balancing the coffee manually instead of relying in its natural composition. Use 1.5 times your normal coffee dosage. We divide the water into 3 parts 20% 40% 40%. In a 250ml cup thats 50ml, 100ml, 100ml which I call the juice, buffer and bitter respectively. 

Do note this technique is wasteful and not recommended regularly. The technique I used is simply an upright aeropress, plunging in about the rubber seal's depth and then pulling out, repeated. This allows us to have fine control over our flow rate. Try to close the plunger quickly. After adding the first 50ml, stirring is recommended followed by using the plunger to stop flow.

The result is 3 cups of liquds. Which can be now balanced together in your desired proportion. A good starting point is mixing half of your buffer with the juice and a few spoonfulls of the bitter. Add normal water to dilute as necessary.   


This is purely an experiment for now and not a brewing guide. Give it a shot and let me know how it worked out for you. We might be able to make an interesting brewing method out of our experiecnes.

As I am making coffee since past year I dedicated myself to experiment with different combinations of temperature, grind size, rate of flow of water, coffee to water ratio and now I'm thinking about....If I should change my water.
I have 3 options right here: 
1) Do not chage water and keep using my RO water purifier.
2) Use bottled water.
3) Make own water by Mixing combination of minerals with distilled water

Okay don't get me wrong, I know that 3rd option is best and tbh it's a bit of work(I'm very lazyyy) the question is which of them is best and even if it's worth it changing water in India atleast

Which turned out nice, though not as fuller bodied as with AP. How about with an MP, I thought. Bad decision, almost. Then came the FP. It was a revelation. It was so good, giving me the best of almost every world ... flavours, body, intensity. And it doesn't finish as fast as a shot of espresso. Damn.

# Method and materials:

Timemore C2 set at 14 clicks

Espro bloom pour over with espro filter paper

**Recipe:**

* 25g coffee: 400g water (1:16 ratio)
* Water at 100°C
* 30 second bloom with \~50 g water
* \~40 gram swirls of water with \~25 second intervals in between making sure the bed of coffee doesn't go dry
* Total draw time \~4 minute 35 seconds

# Tasting notes:

(Taste is subjective and these are my first impressions)

Brewed coffee smells like sweet caramel with a hint of clove.

First sip tastes weirdly empty with a very very mild bittersweet aftertaste. Subsequent sips taste faintly of caramel toffee with a very faint hint of fruit like acidity and chocolate bitterness. By the end of the cup, the chocolaty bitterness ends up being the dominant lingering note but it's still very faint overall.  It's *feels* like it's a good cup but everything tastes muted. I'm thinking this isn't really well suited for a filter brew. Probably would brew better with immersion methods.

Trying with the french press (1:16 ratio, 20 clicks on timemore c2) next day didn't go *too* much better. First few sips are again empty but this time with a sweet aftertaste with a hint of clove like spiciness. Subsequent sips have a noticable acidic fruit like taste. Reads like candy/artificial mango flavour to me. Unlike the previous brew, there's not much bitter notes and the fruity note dominates here. Though it doesn't feel as ""empty"" as the previous brew, it's still all very muted compared to the coffees I'm used to. There is also a drying mouth feel after each sip. The artificial mango note remains unchanged till the last sip. I like this cup a lot better but still not a fan of this one. A 1:12 ratio would probably improve things on the french press.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/11rxhtu/luna_robusta_carbonic_maceration_medium_roast_by/

I bought an espresso machine recently, first bag of beans is Blue Tokai Stanmore Estate medium roast. It took me about 8 shots to nail the grind size - 18g in 36g out in 35 seconds. However I found the taste quite sour.

I increased the temperature to 95°C from the default 93°C and pushed the yield over the next few shots to 40, 41 and 43 grams. Now I still taste some sourness (much less than before though) but the flavour notes are no longer discernible. The pack says malta orange, guava &amp; milk chocolate. Ofcourse the slight sourness is somewhat like orange but I really cannot taste guava or milk choc. 

There was a point when I pulled a 36g shot where the guava notes were clearly there but that shot was too sour to enjoy.

Are light &amp; medium roasts just supposed to be sour? Or am I doing something wrong?

Equipment:

* Machine - Profitec 300
* Grinder - Eureka Silenzio
* Tamper - push click tamper (levelled tamp)

I calculated the price of our daily caffeine (200mg minimum, 2 cups per day) via different methods

1. **Caffeine pills** :- 5 rs/day (1 pill 1/2, 2 time a day) [This one]( https://amzn.eu/d/cv5sasG)

*  **Instant coffee**:- [This one](https://amzn.eu/d/ayAeo9n)

A. With milk :-  40 or 52 rs/day (2 cups)

200ml low fat milk ( amul taza) + 3 gm or 5 gm coffee + sugar (10.5 + 8.5 or 14.5 + 1 = 20 or 26 ) 

B. With water :- 17 or 29 rs/day ( 2 cups)


3. **Speciality coffee**

Now first thing about accessories that need to make it...

==&gt;&gt; Now Most praised and used **equipments** in this sub (imo) are :-

1. [V60](https://amzn.eu/d/1CkDqbf) with 1 year worth paper filters ( [hario white v2](https://amzn.eu/d/4eugOWq) )  :-
 467 + 1512 (420 x 3.6) = 1979


2. [Aeropress](https://amzn.eu/d/hXP7c5s) :- 3200

3. [KaldiPress ](https://amzn.eu/d/dEUuIIr) / Desi aeropress :- 1500

4.[French press](https://amzn.eu/d/55lANnM) :- from 500 to 2000 ( above one is example)

5. [South Indian filter coffee maker ](https://amzn.eu/d/baCKkI4) :- from 300 to 1400 ( not mentioning aramse one)


6. [Moka pot](https://amzn.eu/d/9qUTJYK) :- from 600 to 8000

Not going to talk about espresso machine cause don't know much about it and don't care to research about it right now.

===&gt;&gt; **weight scale** :-

 A. [Hoffen](https://amzn.eu/d/gr5l6i8) :- 1400

B. [Instacuppa](https://amzn.eu/d/6qYIyS5) :- 2000

C. [Hario](https://amzn.eu/d/9hhfMeJ) :- 11000 ( price has some drip man..)

===&gt;&gt;  **gooseneck kettle** :-

A. [Instacuppa](https://amzn.eu/d/0W4u8kx) :- 2500

B. [Agaro](https://amzn.eu/d/bTlz0lA) :- 3600

===&gt;&gt;&gt;  ** Coffee Grinders** :-

A. [Timemore chestnut c2](https://amzn.eu/d/ivIudX6) :- 4300 

You can use blade grinder ( normal spice grinder at home) if you can't afford above one watch [James Hoffman ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7d-5KWHCU) video about it
 
===&gt;&gt;&gt; For **temprature** control freaks :-  

buy electric [Kettle](https://amzn.eu/d/erE4rOv) with inbuilt thermometer

 or

 buy kitchen [Thermometer ](https://amzn.eu/d/fU72XI2)

Or just eyeball it 

===&gt;&gt;&gt; Now all equipment considered

We are going to see from most cheap to most expensive methods (combination of minimum price equipments in each one)

A. If you are a broke (student mostly) snob just chew goddam caffeine pills and study to gain money for later methods 

B. Instant coffee with water

C. South Indian filter coffee with milk ( cause sif coffee powder is cheap than instant one)

D. Instant coffee with milk

E. [V60 x french press](https://medium.com/@brewtested/v60-x-french-press-a66004306ab7) with muslin cloth + weight scale :- 467 + 150 + 1400 = 2000

F. French press + WS :- 1100 + 1400 = 2500

G. Kaldipress + ws :- 1500 + 1400 = 2900

H. Moka pot + ws :- 2000 + 1400 = 3400

I. Aeropress + ws :- 3200 + 1400 = 4600

J. V60 + filter paper (1 year) + ws + gooseneck kettle :-  467 + 1512 + 1400 + 2500 = 5880

K. Espresso :- starts from 10k ( wonderchef) to go beyond 1 lac ( don't know much about it)

Now this all prices are with pre ground coffee ,

So add another 4.2 k ( timemore c2 ) in all above if you want to add a basic good reliable grinder ( according to this sub) for freshly ground coffee 

===&gt;&gt;&gt; Now come to the main point of all above :-

If you drink 2 cups a black coffee per day ( morning and evening) with 14 GM coffee each time so 28 GM per day.

Now you buy speciality coffee by 1 kg at a time 
So 1000/28 = 35.71 ~36 days 

So it will run for 1 month ( for who concern about storage buy beans and vaccum them in small quantities and put in freezer) [Here](https://prestocoffee.com/blogs/coffee/how-long-does-coffee-last-in-a-vacuum-sealed-bag)

So if you buy coffee by 

A. 1200 per kg :- 33.6 rs per day (for 2 cups )

B. 1300 per kg :-  36.4     ""

C. 1400 per kg :-  39.2     ""

D. 1500 per kg :-  42

E. 1600 per kg :-  44.8

F. 1700 per kg :-  47.6

G. 1800 per kg:-  50.4

So you got the point,

Now if you go out to your local shop ( tapri ) they might sell you instant coffee for 25 to 30 rs ( I am guessing here)

Or go to tea post they might sell 40 to 60 RS per cup ( price may very from location to location)

So let's say you drink twice from outside ( tea post let's say 50 rs for 1 cup) it will cost you 100 rs per day for that and it's nowhere near to speciality one which is 50 rs per day 

===&gt;&gt;&gt;  So who want to enter this hobby or whatever this is 

A. Go for SIF if you want milk based coffee

B. For not caring about ethics, go with kaldipress + hoffen scale ( under 3 k budget) with pre ground coffee ( try quater [First ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/y24ugr/aeropress_made_juicier_and_sweeter_the_quater/) method from u/NotRealHyde) 

C.for ethical ones go for aeropress + hoffen scale + timemore c2

D. V60 for who like to go for very steep learning curve and delicious cup of coffee ( it will be worth it in end though)

E. For kothibangala walas go for espresso...

Aero/ kaldipress is very forgiving method.

Now it's my opinion and some minor puns and jokes so don't take it seriously, 

any respectful criticism is welcome.

P.s. 

you can use jwellery scale also like [This](https://amzn.eu/d/5I0TXrJ) 
it's range from 300 to 500

And also buy [This](https://amzn.eu/d/8z4nkNG), 

it is plastic calibrated beaker to measure water (90 rs), 

There are [Glass](https://amzn.eu/d/2tjckzf) one also and it looks cool for photos too.

So if you don't buy the hoffen scale and go for jwellery scale + beaker it will coast you 400 to 500 rs 

And for timer use mobile stopwatch",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/11wug4e/by_comparison_speciality_coffee_is_cheaper_than/

Koinonia's Winter Espresso Blend is supposed to be good when brewed in a Moka Pot. Now, my Moka Pot technique, largely distilled from the Wired Gourmet, is rather good. I've had great cups from it. So I looked forward to this blend. But the last 2-3 MP-brewed cups pale in comparison to what I got today from the humble French Press. Damn. At this rate, I might just get rid of all my other brewers.

Grinder and setting: 1zpresso JX pro, 160 clicks (yes, there are 4 clicks between every two numbers)

Coffee: Winter Espresso Blend from Koinonia

French Press: Wonderchef basic but fitted with an extra filter. (I get rather clean brews by FP standards)

Method: Water just off the boil, added in a 1:10 ratio, stirred in straight lines and steeped for 15 minutes. At the 14th minute mark, stir once more. Wait for a minute and then pour. I even press the plunger hard while it is draining. (Aakhri doh boond, glass mein).

So what am I doing wrong with the MP or is it a case of doing FP very well or have I changed irrevocably in my simplicity journey?

For the first method, I used a tea infuser ball. I used my Timemore C2 Max to grind my coffee coarsely [26 clicks]. I dropped the ball into a cup full of 95°C water, and the results were a bit hollow and muddy but had a pleasant taste overall. I used 15 grams for 240 grams of water. I'm no expert at tasting, so I'll just stick to my limited vocabulary. It tasted good, left a pleasant aftertaste, and there was no sourness or astringency. But the cup was weak, so I felt I could do better.

So I decided to try using my mother's tea infuser pot. This time, I ground the beans two clicks finer and thought I'd give my beans a sift using a strainer since the last method left a lot of sediment. I ended up sifting away almost 3 grams before I decided to stop. I steeped the remaining 12 grams in 192 grams of water, and this yielded an even weaker cup. Maybe it was because I sifted away all the fines?

I used The Caffeine Bar's HSD (my usual) and steeped both batches for 4 minutes.

I would appreciate any thoughts/suggestions from pros or anyone who has tried something like this before.

P.S. I don't own a French press and don't think I'd make use of it if I ever got one. I just realized how many fines my grinder produces at coarser settings, so I doubt a French press would work for my setup (I have a V60, a Hario Buono, a Timemore C2 Max, and an Aeropress). I'm very much a pour-over person (used the Aeropress only while traveling) and I just decided to try this today because I had some time to kill.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12bdysq

Had been waiting to dip into homebrewing espresso since forever. My SO finally gifted me the Flair Neo. This community and reddit helped us zero in on the best model for me given our budgetary constraints. Hence- came the Neo.

These are some of the shots I pulled- took a lot of tinkering and dialing in but since the last 10 days I am able to pull out really tasty shots.

Once again- I big thank you to all the Gyan in this sub-reddit.  


How I zeroed in:  


**Coffee**\- Vienna Roast from BT  
**Dose**: 15g

**Grinder:** Timemore C2 (yet to upgrade, but pressurized portafilter helps)

**Grind setting on C2-** 12 clicks  


Pre heating using boiled water in the brew chamber- three times.   


Using a homemade WDT for puck preparation

**Pre infusion**\- 20 sections

**Total Shot time-** 65 seconds

1) Tried blue tokai Attikan estate, Silver oak blend and their birthday roast and I've realised I prefer medium to dark roasts.

2) Extraction methods: I've tried cold brew (1:5) 18-20 hrs using mason jar and a cheese cloth and SIF (1:4) for 3 min.

3) I've realised I like my coffee thicc decadent and creamy and my coffee lacks body. It's straight up like coffee water. I've played around with coffee to water ratio, used full cream milk or straight up cream and used condensed milk as a sweetner but i doesn't give me the body i expect it to. I've ordered a super fine nylon mesh with 100 microns diameter (the size reference from a French press filter) to replace my cheese cloth hoping it'll help the body.

4) I use preground coffee from blue tokai. Will freshly ground coffee make a real difference? I'm not in a place in my life where I could spend on a coffee grinder so can I substitute it with the traditional mixier?

5) Are the moka pots from Amazon for 600-700 ish worth it? I've read on this sub that mokapot gives amazing body.

6) As of now I like adding 1 tsp of Nescafe instant coffee and blending my full cream milk with a hand held blender (makes it super creamy) and adding my cold brew concentrate to the creamy mixture so i doesn't feel watery. (unconventional ik, don't come for my throat)

u/an8207,Journey towards buying a prosumer Espresso Machine in India,13,2023-04-26 20:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/12zjxou/journey_towards_buying_a_prosumer_espresso/,"There are so many variables to control while making an espresso such as Brewing Temperature, Brewing Pressure, Grind Settings, brew ratio, brewing time, tamping pressure, water quality, nature of the beans, type of roasting method, etc that a newbie, who in search for that perfect shot, can easily be overwhelmed

Thus, in order to minimize the errors possible from these variables and get consistent shots, choosing the right espresso machine and a right grinder is MORE important for a newbie given his/her lack of skill as compared to a Barista. 

I wanted a machine with a temperature control PID (more on this later) and hence some popular choices - the Gaggia Classic Pro, Delonghi Dedica, Ranchilio Silva, etc were out of question. Why PID? For the simple reason that getting the temperature right is critical while making espresso and adjusting the temperature ""manually"" is not my cup of tea (or coffee). I can barely get consistent results on a pour over/aeropress despite having a weighing scale. Due to my lack of skill, non-PID machines were out of question.

Also I do not like the coffee produced from automatic espresso machines (which grind and brew coffee at touch of button) apart from the fact that even these machines are similarly priced. 

Following is a short note on the various factors I considered prior to purchasing an espresso machine

**TEMPERATURE & IMPORTANCE OF PID CONTROL**

* Maintaining consistent water temperature during the brewing process is one of critical features      of an espresso machine. Hence one of the most important features to look for in a prosumer espresso machine is whether it has a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller. Machines without PID need some adjustments. If the machine doesnt have PID control, the temperature regulation is done adjusting the temperature needs to be done manually and given my lack of skill, this was a key factor in my decision-making process.
* So what is a PID Control and how does it help: Simply put it is temperature control system that allows you to set the brew temperature and ensures that it remains consistent during the brewing process. This takes away all the hassle and all you have to do is set the temperature on the digital display and you are done!
* Single PID and Dual PID: Some machines have a Dual PID control for independently controlling the temperature of the Brew Boiler and the Steam Boiler

In my view buying a machine in 2023 with a PID control is essential even if it involves spending a little more. Some good starting options are the Lelit Anna PID and the Profitec Go (unfortunately not yet available in India)

**SINGLE BOILER vs HEAT EXCHANGER vs DUAL BOILER**

When it comes to home espresso machines, there are generally three types of boilers: single boiler, heat exchanger, and dual boiler. Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice ultimately depends on your preferences and needs.

* Single Boiler: A single boiler machine has just one boiler, which is used for both brewing      espresso and steaming milk. This means that you cannot brew and steam simultaneously, and you have to wait for the boiler to heat up or cool down between brewing and steaming. Single boiler machines are generally the most affordable option, but they may not be suitable if you need to      make multiple drinks quickly. Some Examples: Rancilio Silvia, Lelit Anna, Gaggia Classic Pro, Breville Bambino Plus
* Heat Exchanger: While Heat exchanger machines also have single boiler, they allow you to steam milk and pull espresso at the same time. This is done by a heat exchanger system wherein heat from the steam boiler is used to heat the brew water. Heat exchanger machines are better than single boiler machines but they do not offer as much control over temperature and pressure as dual boiler machines. Some Examples: Rocket Appartamento, Lelit Mara, Profitec Pro 500 PID
* Dual Boiler: A dual boiler machine has two separate boilers, one for brewing and one for      steaming. This means that you can brew and steam simultaneously, without any wait time. Dual boiler machines are generally the most expensive option, but they offer the most precise temperature control and are the best choice for making high-quality espresso. They are also the most durable and long-lasting option, as they are designed to handle heavy use. Some Examples: Profitec Pro 300, Rancilio Silvia Pro X, Lelit Bianca, Lelit Elizabeth, La Marzocco GS/3, Profitec Pro 700

**Milk Steaming**

As you might have guessed, Dual Boilers are best at Milk Steaming followed by Heat Exchangers and then Single Boiler. Furthermore, the milk steaming capability also depends on the capacity of your Steam Boiler (in case of Dual Boiler Machines). Understand how many milk based drink you will make back to back in order to decide between Single Boiler (and Heat Exchanger) vs Dual Boiler. In case you go ahead with the Dual Boiler, the you must also decide how much capacity of the Steam Boiler is needed for your requirements

Hence, in general Dual Boiler > Heat Exchanger > Single Boiler. However, like most generalizations, it is not always correct. SOME examples: 

* Lets assume that you  brew only 1-2 cups at a time then in such a case buying a Dual Boiler is an overkill. 
* You are primarily an espresso drinker and only occasionally drink milk based drinks 
* You are starting out on your espresso journey and you know that the machine that you will buy is      not your ""endgame"" then going with a machine with all bells and whistles at the start itself is not needed till you perfect your knowledge/skill. 

In the examples above, instead of buying a dual boiler you can save money with a Single Boiler or Heat Exchanger and use the savings to buy a better grinder

**START-UP TIME**

* The start-up time of an espresso machine refers to the time it takes for the machine to heat up      and become ready to use for both brewing and steaming. I had naively assumed that the higher end prosumer machines will start up more quickly than the entry/mid level ones but that it is clearly not the case. This start-up time is dependent on the type of machine (Heat Exchanger vs Dual Boiler) and the size of its boilers. 
* In general, heat exchanger machines tend to have a faster start-up time compared to dual boiler machines as they have only one boiler for heating water and producing steam. Therefore their start up are shorter - typically 3-5 minutes. On the other hand Dual boiler machines have separate boilers for each function and therefore this means it takes longer for both boilers to heat up. The size of the boilers can also affect start-up time. Smaller boilers will heat up faster than larger      ones, but they may not be able to maintain consistent temperature and pressure during extended use. Larger boilers take longer to heat up but can provide more stable temperature and pressure over a longer period of time. Dual Boiler machines can take 20-30 minutes (or more) for startup.      Note that the above reference points are in case you want to make a milk based drink such as a cappuccino or a latte. In case you want to make an espresso, then the machine will be available for use faster.

In my view, Start-up time is something people should seriously keep in mind before buying their machine. You don't have to take a high capacity Dual Boiler (which will result in a 20-30 minutes start-up time) if you don't NEED that capacity. 

Since my usage was 2-3 cups daily with higher use on occasions, I chose a dual boiler with smaller steam capacity so as to minimize the startup time. 

**PRE-INFUSION**

Pre-infusion is another feature that is commonly found in prosumer espresso machines. This refers to the process of wetting the coffee grounds with a small amount of water before applying full pressure to extract the espresso shot. This can help to ensure more even extraction and reduce the chances of channelling or other extraction issues.

I was initially very stuck up and insisted on getting a machine with pre-infusion. However, most of the low & mid level machines come with a vibration pump (more on this below) which does not ramp up pressure as quickly as the more expensive rotary pump. While this may seem like a disadvantage, it actually results in machines with vibration pumps getting a 'kind of' pre-infusion. Also pre-infusion works best for light roasted coffees and in case you like medium, medium-dark, dark roast coffees it does not make that much difference. 

Personally, since I do not prefer light roaster coffees, I overcame my initial hesitation and considered machines without preinfusion capability. 

**PRESSURE AND TYPES OF PUMPS**

* Another key factor in brewing great espresso is pressure. The ideal pressure for an espresso      shot is typically between 8 and 10 bars and a prosumer espresso machine should be able to easily maintain this pressure CONSISTENTLY (with only minor variations) in the brew process. Inability to maintain CONSISTENT pressure during the brewing happens is a common problem in lower end espresso machines and this problem is USUALLY not there in prosumer models and hence I did not talk about pressure earlier. 
* Some machines also provide a pressure gauge (called manometer) for the Brew Boiler (and sometimes also for the Steam Boiler) which is very helpful and can give you an indication of the variability of pressure during the brewing process. Just note that the pressure gauge in most machines measures the pressure at the brew boiler and not at the group head. Typically, if the pressure gauge shows 10 bar at the brew boiler, the pressure at the group head will be lower at around 9 bar. 
* Nowadays, quite a few machines also have an ability to change the pressure from the standard 9      bar. If this is available it is a good plus. Even when its not available, there are also videos available online that show how to modify the pressure by opening up the machine (beyond my capability)

**Types of Pumps**

There are two main types of pumps: rotary pumps and vibration pumps. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. 

* Vibration pumps are more commonly found in entry-level and mid-range espresso machines. They      are smaller, lighter, less expensive and easier to maintain/replace, but have a lesser lifespan (typically 5-6 years). 
* Rotary pumps are typically found in high-end and commercial-grade espresso machines. They      are larger, heavier, and more expensive than vibration pumps, but they are also more robust & durable, have a larger lifespan and are more quieter. Rotary Pumps can also be plumbable directly to a water line, which is useful in a Cafe/Restaurant setup but might not be so useful for a home. They are also capable of maintaining a more consistent pressure throughout the brewing process and people say that can lead to more flavourful shots. 

Having said that, both pumps produce great espresso and as stated earlier, vibratory pumps with their slow ramp-up of pressure help in pre-infusion

The choice of pump and the ability to adjust pressure were not critical factors for me. As long as the machine operated at a consistent pressure at the group head I was fine. Having said that, many professional reviewers check the pressure & temperature at the grouphead during the brewing process using a 'SCACE' device. Checking out these reviews is a MUST in other to see how closely the machine lives up to the manufacturer's claim.

**FLOW CONTROL**

Flow control is another feature that is becoming increasingly popular in prosumer espresso machines. This allows for more precise control over the water flow rate during the extraction process, which can help to achieve more consistent and flavourful shots. Some machines offer this feature out of the box, while others may require additional modifications or add-ons.

For me personally, this feature was an overkill given my lack of skill level and lack of interest to try the same. 

**GROUP HEAD**

The group head is the part that connects the portafilter to the machine and allows hot water to flow through the coffee grounds, extracting the flavor and creating the espresso shot. Whether the take a machine with a traditional E61 grouphead or not is one of the questions. The E61 was invented in the year 1961 and hence it is a well known and matured technology. Spare parts availability is fairly easy and it is popular among espresso enthusiasts. However, it requires more maintenance, doesnt heat up as fast, is more complex, and has a larger footprint. I was ok with not having a E61 grouphead given its disadvantages. As long as the group head used by the machine is known to be reliable, I was ok. You can check online reviews for the same. 

Another thing to consider is the size of the portafilter. 58mm portafilters (vs 54 mm, the other common size) allow more dosage of coffee and because it is a standard size it is easier to find accessories such as tampers, distributors, etc. Hence I wanted a 58mm portafilter so that I can easily swap out the bundled one and put a different one, if required 

**SERVICEABILITY & LONGEVITY**

This was a critical factor for me. A good prosumer machine are known to last 10+ years. If you are further along in your espresso journey and want the current machine to be (or close to be) your 'endgame' then checking the pedigree of the brand, checking out user experiences/reviews of the specific model, understanding the build quality of the machine and its components are a MUST do activity. While I can understand that things can still go wrong & you can get a bad piece but it is better to have the odds in your favour.

All this has to be coupled with verifying the availability of service and support in your region. 

**BUYING A GOOD GRINDER**

Imagine you have Virat Kohli or Faf du Plessis in your IPL team but you get them to bat Number 9. You will not be able to extract the benefit of taking such an accomplished player in your team. Similarly, a good espresso machine without a good grinder will not be able to achieve desired results. 

Some of things to consider are the grind consistency, burr size, burr type (conical vs flat), material of construction of the burrs, noise, single dosing capability, adjustment capability and size. The favourite on most forums is the Niche Zero. However it is not available in India

Some of the considerations that went into buying a good grinder as follows: 

* Baratza Vario Plus / W Plus priced at roughly Rs 50k sold by BlueTokai. Note that Baratza Forte is also a great grinder but is focussed on Commercial Use
* Eureka Mignon Specialita priced at roughly Rs 45k sold by Coffee Plus (a Delhi based      company)
* Eureka Mignon Single Dose Rs 60k sold by Coffee Plus
* Mahlkönig X54: Priced at roughly Rs 74k sold by Somethings Brewing (a subsidiary of Kaapi      Machines)

All the three manufacturers - Baratza, Eureka and Mahlkönig are extremely well reputed and well known. 

A big thing nowadays is buying a Single Dose grinders. They are designed to grind only the amount of coffee needed for a single serving or ""dose"" of coffee. Unlike other types of grinders that grind a large amount of coffee into a hopper, a single dose grinder typically has a small hopper or none at all, and requires the user to measure out the exact amount of coffee needed for each shot. This results in more freshness, little to no retention of beans and more precise control. This trend picked up steam when the Niche Zero (not available in India) was launched and the traditional manufacturers have now started following suit. In the options above, as the name suggests, only the Eureka Mignon Single Dose is a Single Dose Grinder.

What was AMAZING to a Noob like me was that for the SAME BEANS different grinders will result in taste differences. The Eureka are known to accentuate clarity & sweetness and while the Baratza Vario Plus accentuates Body, syrupy feeling and the traditional espresso taste. Furthermore, a Vario Plus (which comes with Ceramic Burrs) tastes different from a Vario W+ (which comes with metal burrs). Thus choosing a grinder depends on what kind of coffee you prefer! See Lance Hedrick's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG29V2Y4Yjw&t=2414s) and Wired Gourmet's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjMNwU_6nto&t=829s) on youtube to get an idea on this. Even [Baratza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzlKFtUIhno&t=427s) suggests that if make Espresso most of the times, the Vario Plus is a better option.

Thus all of the above grinders are good and it all depends on what kind of taste profile you have. 

**SELECTING MY MACHINE**

In a nutshell I was looking for a Dual Boiler PID Machine with a start time under 15 minutes, having a 58mm portafilter and manufactured from a reputed brand.

I checked out the options available from Bluetokai, Somethings Brewing and Coffee Plus

Some of the options I came across were

* Lelit Anna PID: Its a good Single Boiler Machine with a PID for starting your espresso machine.      However I was willing to spend more
* Profitec Go: Just like the Anna PID this is also a GREAT Single Boiler machine manufactured by      the reputed German Brand Profitec. Again those starting on their espresso journey can check it out. Unfortunately it is not yet available in India
* Profitec Pro 300: This ticked all my boxes except that it did not have pre infusion. A minor      complaint was that it did not have a pressure gauge for the Brew Boiler. 
* Ranchilio Silva Pro X: This machine from Ranchilio was just launched last year and it ticked all      the boxes
* Lelit Elizabeth: This was another good option and priced at roughtly Rs 1.35lacs
* Bellona: There were some models from a company called Bellona. It is a relatively newer      company and that is why I didnt consider it. Furthermore, Somethings  Brewing was asking a huge sum of Rs 1.90 lacs for the Belleza which, apart  from being more expensive/at par with other reputed European      manufacturers, was substantially a lot more than the price offered by      dealers in Europe (around 1350 euros translating to roughly Rs 1.22 lacs) for it.
* Lelit Bianca: Another great option but priced at Rs 2.20 lacs.
* La Marzocco Linea Mini Home: A beautiful machine but priced very high as Rs 4.60 lacs. It is for      someone who wants the best and doesnt mind paying the price.

Considering my budget and specifications desired, I shortlisted the Ranchilio Silva X, Lelit Elizabeth and the Profitec 300. Ranchilio Silva X was my first option as Ranchilio are known to make tank like machines that last years. The machine was being sold by Somethings Brewing and upon speaking to them I was informed that the 'Pro X' (and not simply 'Pro') model is not readily available and delivery would take 4 months. Furthermore, they were quoting Rs 1.8 lacs which was significantly above Europe prices. 

The second option was the Lelit Elizabeth and I spoke to Mr. Alok from Coffee Plus and he was kind enough to patiently explain about the machine, about Lelit and Coffee Plus. Lelit is an Italian brand which has been offering great features at price points lower than other European companies. The reviews of the Elizabeth were pretty good. The only thing against it (for me!) was that while it is an upcoming brand, it was not yet reached the pedigree of a Profitec or Ranchilio. Secondly and maybe more importantly I am not based in NCR and consequently serviceability may be limited in my city. 

The third option was the Profitec 300. Profitec is a well reputed German manufacturer which is known for its build quality and high quality components. The Pro 300 is a model which has been around for a while. It fulfilled all most of my requirements except pre-infusion. As explained earlier, given my preference for medium-dark to dark roasts, this was not a problem. The machine is normally priced at Rs 1.32 lacs. Bluetokai, today, is offering 20% discount on all products on its website. Consequently the Pro 300 is available for Rs 1.06 lacs which is as good (or maybe cheaper) than Europe prices. 

Finally it came down to Profitec Pro 300 (currently available at a discount) and the Lelit Elizabeth. Given the branding of Profitec and the discount, I bit the bullet and purchased the Profitec Pro 300. I have also taken the Baratza Vario Plus grinder to go along with it.

Questions:  
\- how much do I clean it after every use? I can clean the collector and the coarseness adjusted relatively easily, but the insides and the burs are difficult to even see, let alone clean.  
\- I saw some videos of taking it apart and cleaning it throughly. How frequently would that be needed?

I used the ""omni grind"" supermarket coffee (usually Kimbo, but Vegnano when I could afford it. Speciality was unaffordable. So I only put that supermarket grind in.) which was a dark roast. I did this for two years and never had an issue. 
2. I saw Hoffmann and Spromethus videos and made minor adjustments to what I was doing. I will say this did very little to change the overall experience. I suppose those coffees aren't all that great. The only origin note they used to have was  ""Non-EU"". The changes perhaps made the cup a little less muddy. But again, I was getting the thick oozy flow at the beginning, and then it got less dense and then the crema. 
3. I did not and do not have a grinder. I might invest in it later, but for now, I am in India and usually order pre-ground coffee from Blue Tokai or Corridor Seven. It's a different grind size than the one I used to get from the supermarket back in Italy. 
4. I have also tried using coffee sold by a brand called M R Coffee. It's 40% chicory. But sometimes my grandmother visits and she likes that. But I have brewed it. 
5. I have a gas stove at home. I have to use a grilling ring type thing that sits on top of the stove since the stove won't hold my moka. So the arrangement is 
c. moka 
b. the grilling ring thingy 
a. flame 


Here is the problem.
1. Using the BT or C7 coffee I can never get the same flow. I can get coffee (usually tasting and smelling burnt) out of it (40-45 ml) (it's a one-cup moka) but that is when I don't put boiling water to begin with. 
2. If I put boiling water when I start, the coffee is just burns by default (I am using light and medium roasts) (mostly medium) and it starts sputtering and making a damn mess. I get 30 ml of liquid out of it. The rest of the water refuses to me. 
3. I tried changing the way I fill coffee in. I tried changing the amount of coffee. I tried changing the water temp. Nothing works. And I am not sure why. The only thing I haven't tried so far is increasing the distance between the moka and the flame. I suspect that may be the issue. 
4. The worst thing is, if I use the MR coffee (I don't know how to describe its grind) it goes well. It works with boiling water and everything. So the other issue could be the BT/C7 grind. I am not sure. I hate how the MR coffee tastes without milk and i don't want milk in the coffee anymore. 

I have just resigned to using my french press permanently now. So If anyone should have suggestions regarding the Moka. would be very helpful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/13bpekf/moka_making_me_a_maniac/

Disclaimer: About a month or two ago, looking to try Monsooned Malabar coffees I searched this sub for reviews and found a few good reviews saying that ""MM is generally funky and not suitable to everyone's tastes and it can be off putting but Marc's has the best MM they have ever tasted"", at the time it was out of stock so I found a good deal on Bili Hu's MM and ordered a small bag, I liked it, I didn't know what I liked about it, it was very different from other coffees I've tried but I certainly didn't dislike it. 

Now, seeing the sale I ordered Marc's MM but the coffee I got was roasted over 2 weeks ago. Even opening the bag it didn't give me any of the aromas that the previous MM I had did, brewing it was the final nail in the coffin, I have tried V60, Aeropress, Moka Pot. I have drunk it hot and iced but I haven't found any redeeming qualities about this coffee. This is my first ever experience with Marc's and I was excited, don't know if it's a MM thing or a Marc's thing but recent bad reviews from other people on this sub indicate that this might be a Marc's thing. So here I am, disappointed.


Tl;dr :: Ordered Monsooned Malabar from Marc's, tastes bland, roasted over 2 weeks ago, tastes nothing like the previous MM I had from Bili Hu, disappointed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/13iwwbx/marcs_coffee_disappointed/

2. How frequently do you use it? Daily once, daily twice, once every alternate day etc.

3. What is your most common brewing method? And if you are using the grinder to grind beans for some other method, how often do you adjust it?

The goal is to create a platform that aggregates consumer brands, offering a wide range of choices in raw products, drinks, machinery, and brewing methods. I believe this will be equally useful for coffee enthusiasts/beginners  who want to explore different blends, brewing techniques, and coffee-related products.

To kick things off, I'm considering whether to develop a web app or a mobile app for this platform. I would love to hear your thoughts and gather feedback on which option you think would be more convenient and user-friendly.

Additionally, I'd appreciate any suggestions or features you would like to see in such a platform ( Subscriptions? Personalised Preferences ( AI/Non-AI ). Do you have any specific preferences when it comes to browsing and discovering coffee products? What would enhance your current overall  experience? Feel free to share your insights and ideas.

Keep in mind that this is still in the early stages, and I haven't conducted formal research or gathered extensive feedback.

The Ideal vision is having an intuitive UX which gets you exactly what you want in a few taps with ratings and rankings of products from all available options which ship to your address.

Let's discuss and shape this project together! I want to build in public and it would be nice if you all would help in creating a solution that truly meets the needs of coffee enthusiasts. Thank you in advance for your feedback!

So I usually drink my instant coffee black and also like Americanos with double espresso shots. I dont see myself drinking coffee with any additives like Milk, Sugar, Syrup etc.

With that in mind which of this would you suggest as a cost-effective way to get started and get the best cup of joe in the morning?

1. French Press or V60 and drain out the black coffee
2. Aero/Kaldi Press and drain out the espresso and add water to it?

I am planning to get pre-ground coffee depending on the instrument I end up choosing. Will invest in a grinder later as I am currently a student.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/14175e1/instant_coffee_drinker_over_here_would_like_your/

I'm a big coffee lover, and for a few years I also like to brew coffee at home. Since I'm not a professional barista who can brew with his eyes closed, I often relied to different brew timer apps, however all of them had some flaws, therefore I decided to develop my own (with some help of ChatGPT and Stackowerflow)!

Instead of focusing on other apps' disadvantages, let me tell you what makes [Timer.Coffee](https://timer.coffee/) special:

1. It's free and completely open-source, source code is available on github. I think open-source matters not only from ideological perspective, but also because it gives a community a platform to build a better app together. For example, users can submit their own brewing recipes or new functions which will help everyone to dive deeper in the amazing world of coffee. For me specialty coffee was always about community and connections, therefore I think this is a crucial aspect. Also, open-source guarantees that the app won't just disappear from the App Store (as it happened with some apps I used). 2. The app currently supports 7 brewing techniques and 20 recipes with more to come. When I started developing, I quickly realised that it would be much easier technically to assign one recipe to each brewing method, but I didn't want to limit user's choice. 3. You can adjust coffee and water amounts an brew as much as you wish! App will automatically adjust all the recipe steps to reflect the desired amounts.

Also, you can:

\- Mark your most-loved coffee recipes as favorites for easy access.

\- Instantly revisit your last used recipe.

Coming soon:

\- Tetsu Kasuya 4:6 brewing method for Hario V60

\- More recipes!

I would be happy if you'll try my app and it'll help you to enjoy your coffee more. Also, any feedback is highly appreciated.

So when the temperature thingy came up once again in a discussion with a very dear friend, he shared this link which he had shared once before. So today I decided to use it and made coffee with the 80-20 in the Aeropress and brought the water to 175-185, or Stage 3. Steeped for close to 4 minutes and plunged for 20 seconds.

I suppose I should know the response by this time, that I should get a grinder, but since I don't is there a way to get rid of the fines? The method works the same getting me the same amount of fines in the cup if I press the plunger (very very gently) after 4 minutes. 

I don't mind the waiting, just that it is annoying to wait for no reason. I will let the coffee get cold in my cup instead of the French press machine thingy. 

I know why the grinder is important, but if there should be another way I would like to hear it. Will a cloth filter work? 

Also, I want to know if the grinder the roaster is using is no good. or that I am doing it wrong. The coffee tastes fine, no complaints about that. I would like to have that golden liquid to look golden once :P 

The advantage of Hoffmann's method would be in a situation where I won't have access to the machine thingy and would not mind drinking the liquid as a soup with a spoon. Because it is a soup.

Been having coffee made using Aeropress and clever dripper for couple of months now and for the first time tried espresso at Haagen Dazs PMC, chennai and I liked it very much. It was thicker/stronger/darker than my regular AP/CD coffee but not too bitter compared to the coffee from AP/CD . It also had a slightly sweetish (maybe fruity) taste which had a nice feeling in the throat and I was wanting more of that coffee since then. 

Later that day in the same mall had double espresso at Starbucks and liked it as well even though it had very different notes (Not able to remember it properly now). Also at SB, when I got the take away cup with the double espresso, my reaction was its too less which happened to come out loud so the guy topped it with 1 more shot of espresso and when he was doing it, I noticed that the equipment from where the espresso was dripping was nothing like the espresso machines seen on youtube, rather it was something fixed to the table with a long neck. Is this some kind of commercial equipment to make large batches of espresso? 

So now with feeling of  liking espresso and experience going through this forum, I ordered the Budan Moka Pot from SomethingBrewing. Cant wait to experiment with it. 

So below are all the equipment's I acquired since April this year

1) Aeropress GO - This is my first buy and I  used it extensively at home and while travelling 

2) Aeropress regular - Bought this wanting to make bit more coffee but disappointed that the output is very similar to GO (My bad that I did not properly research on the capacity)

3) Clever Dripper - Since I bought this, I stopped using the AP - Using Shieldtail 10 Medium roast and colombia from KC Roasters. Also i saw in one of the YT videos where they pour the hot water first and then the coffee and this method gives better and consistent flavor for me than the method where u put the coffee and then pour hot water.  

4) Timemore Icile - Bought this to use Shieldtail 10 Dark roast from KC roasters to make iced coffee as it was too bitter for my regular coffee and its been working wonders. 

5) Havells i-Conic Kettle - This has 2 temp settings 80\*c and 90\*c and I use only 80\* most of the time for CD. 

6) VAYA DRYNK 350 ml - I use this to drip and drink coffee every day as it stays warm with open cap longer than the ceramic mugs I have. 

7) Budan Mokapot - On the way

Been reading a lot about grinders and different coffee machines but I will wait for a few months before i go on a spending spree. As my wife also started enjoying fresh black coffee with me, I will have to look out for some drip brewing machines which can give me  a total of 600ml (350ml for me and 200ml for wife) in the morning everyday. Please do suggest such drip brewers. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/14pe5eq/i_had_espresso_for_the_first_time_in_life/

I waited out the resting period.

I opened the pack and the first red flag hit me: there was no smell at all. Like, not even the vaguest hint of coffee beans. I might as well be holding a car tyre to my face to smell it.

Anyway, the beans *looked* good. The roast was 100% uniform. I ground it to aeropress size and prayed for the best.

Tried 1:14, 1:12 and 1:10 ratios in my Aeropress. All three times: no taste at all.

Did a fine grind and tried it in my south indian filter. No taste.

Began pulling espresso shots. Tried 1:2.5 and 1:3. Both instances, no taste. At 1:3 it gets disgusting tbh. (kept the ratio high because it's a light-medium roast)

I've paid close to ₹700 for this 250g bag and am starting to feel ripped off. Hunkal Estate's arabica (which costs 1/4 of this) has a better profile...

So looking for rational opinions on:  


* Why does instant coffee have a bad rep? Is it that the tastes here are commoditised, where as in specialty coffees you can pick from huge variety of nuanced tastes? Is that enough to make instant coffee completely untouchable (as some coffee pros do?) Is the tradeoff enough to justify the convenience (took less than 30 seconds for instant coffee cup) 
* Is there a point in the coffee journey after which your palate starts to identify if something is specialty or instant?

Wanting to avoid commercial coffee I decided to grind them and try them out once again. 

They were about 6 months off roast (roasted in Jan 2023), but smelt decent as I ground them (11 on Timemore C2). It was actually better than  how I remember they smelt 1 week off roast. Back then they had a sort of weird funky unpleasant smell, now it was more fruity like a slightly overripe strawberry.

Preheated the water to 90, placed it in the mokapot, brew at lower pressure (mokapot only partially on the fire, moved to the side) 18 grams in 48 grams of coffee out in about a minute and a half.  Tasted it before diluting.... and surprise, I could actually get strawberry notes up front, followed by a sort of dark raisin/blackberry (?) taste and then a cocoa like finish. Slight over extraction at the end, but wow very different from before.  

Was surprised by how much better it tasted now, 6 months later, than before. Back then it was sort of ashy, tasteless and...really felt like a nothing coffee. Perhaps they needed more rest? I have no idea how they can taste this much better after so long.

TLDR: So..If you guys still have the old Naturals 1.0 beans from fraction 9 , try giving them a second chance, they are actually tasted kind of decent. In fact I actually prefer these to the 2.0 version now.

I thought I'd order a bunch of single origins direct from Veer Attikan and Cauvery Peak.

First impressions are mixed. Veer Attikan's roasts seem a bit darker than indicated - for example, the Sholiga (sold as a ""light medium roast"") is as dark, if not darker, than Pavithra (""medium roast"") and a hell of a lot darker than light roasts from other roasters. The roasts are also a bit uneven. 

I bought a Cauvery Peak sampler pack, and the roasts seem slightly better, but the bean grading looks pretty bad, with a lot of size variation, defects and broken beans. 

Both are very freshly roasted, too much so in fact, so although I've experimented with a couple of pour-overs, I'm giving them all a few days to degass before getting serious. 

My only point of comparison in terms of buying direct from estate is Hunkal Heights - their Aranya Gold is \*far\* more evenly roasted, and the beans show much greater regularity of size and form.

I've tried several brands (TATA, Bru, Nescafe, Sunrise, Countrybean, Sleepyowl) but come back to Nescafe because it doesn't have that strange, out-of-place bitter taste, unlike the others. 

Since I drink coffee so often (twice a day, almost every day), I think it's time to change to more professional equipment and better coffee now that I've earned my first stipend as an intern :)

After searching the internet, I settled on getting a [French press](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B088WCFPQF/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A19HTYWV6C3BNO&psc=1) and Blue Tokai's coffee grounds. 

I've got two questions for the people here:

1. Is the aforementioned French Press a good investment/are there better ones out there you'd like to recommend?
2. Which Blue Tokai coffee should I order? I'm confused because some people seem to hate medium roast which makes me think dark roast is better but I also don't want super bitter coffee (I'll also add a splash of milk if that's relevant) and even among the roasts, there are different ones like Vienna or Silver Oak. Please recommend the one you think might be best for French press, not extremely bitter, preferably not acidic and tastes good with a splash of milk.

Long-time lurker, a first time poster. I had been hitherto using SleepyOwl cold brew packs and recently switched to Devan's cold brew packs. They are relatively simple to make, just plonk one inside water and you're good to go.

The quality of Devan's cold brew was drastically better than the Sleepy Owl, albeit I did like the different flavours of SleepyOwl. But this made me want to try different coffees for making a cold brew and I recently picked up a Hario Mizudashi 600 ml from Amazon (yet to be delivered).

But now I am kind of confused about whether 600 ml is enough or whether it'd be better to buy the 1L version. I read online that the 1000 ml size does not allow the grounded coffee to seep in the water properly so the 600 ml is the way to go. Further, I am a bit skeptical about whether 600 ml would be enough to last for a while.

I have tried making a cold brew using a cheesecloth, but the process was quite tedious. Are there any better alternatives to cheesecloth if I want to go the traditional route?

TIA!

So I started my journey with Speciality coffee yesterday. 
Hope I got all the required equipment.
1. KaldiPress 
2. HealthSense Kitchen Scale
3. Agaro Manual Coffee Grinder
4. Coffee - You can check the picture 😃
5. Prestige Kettle 
If not, any suggestion for additional equipment is welcome.😄
Planning to buy a variable temp gooseneck kettle after a few days as I already had the prestige one, so using it for now.
I am heating the water till it boils then waiting for 45 seconds to 1 minute before pouring it for that 85 to 90 deg temp recommended in most brewing methods.

But I must say, moving on from simply mixing a spoon of instant coffee in a cup and stirring it to use 5 or 6 things at once is a little overwhelming for me. 
Yesterday I forgot to use a timer before brewing. Today I used an app called Brew Timer from Google Play but couldn't keep up with the countdown and took more time to complete each step. The coffee tasted a little bitter, maybe because of my mistakes.

Grinding beans is taking a little more time and effort than I expected 😂. I could have got the AGARO Electric grinder at the same price as the manual but thought the manual would be better.

Anyways, hope will get everything right soon.",https://i.redd.it/fb6rnome04eb1.jpg

could anyone speak to the quality of the coffee processing in kerala? share any contacts or websites for sourcing greens?

Bought a limited edition Mizoram bean from Humblebean.
I had quite a bit of expectations from the bean, honestly but felt underwhelmed.
I am used to the sweeter, fruity  a bit of sour and bitter notes from the coffees from Coorg and Chikmagalur ( Riverdale N72 and Hosabane are great).

The one from Mizoram did not give me whole rounded flavors.  The flavour profile abruptly stopped before the sweeter/fruity notes kicked in.

I mostly eyeball my water, temperature and the grammage. Aeropress is quite generous and gives me a good cup almost every time so I can't give you exact details of my brews.

However, has anyone tried coffees from Northeast? Any recommendations on how to brew coffees from that region? Anything particular that I should be doing?

Any suggestions, hacks would be appreciated.

i’m new to brewing after gifting my self a delonghi dedica. got myself a dark roast from 3rd wave, a medium roast from bt and another from a local cafe (partners buy). 

here’s the problem.

started with 3rd waves dark roast- setting: temp high, biggest basket with 14g , tightly packed, coarse ground (store settings used was 9/15, 3 being super fine) - output was nice and thick with good froth.. nice puck too.. couple of hours later, in the loo on the pot with major loosies (loose motions)

wife would use the local one. lovely fine grains (assuming it’s made for the old school decoction maker). same settings. nice thick output after a prolonged run on each extraction. puck very liquidy with watery layer on top. no loosies 

so continued with changing settings to optimise my puck hardness, but no luck yet.

now got my self the medium roast and did the same. very liquidy output with an acidic taste, good puck. Buuuuut an hour later in the loo with a description i’m assuming you all can picture yourself.

so, wtf am i doing wrong??? am i the only one??",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/15pr5jb/weird_question_on_bowels_after_brewing/

This is the combo that i've thought of after researching a bit.

\- Aeropress - 4.1k

\- Aeropress filters \~400

\- Timemore chestnut C2 Grinder - 4.5k

\- Coffee beans \~500 (Blue tokai 250g bag)

So, it'll all amount to around 10k, is this a good setup for a beginner? or should i be considering something else too. Let me know your thoughts or any advice for coffee newbie in general.

In the wooden attic with slanted slate roofs I fount a Moka pot without handle.  It set me off on a journey where I brewed numerous bad coffee until I discovered the following brewing steps.   


1. Hot Boiling water in Kettle. 
2. Boiling water in Moka pot with freshly grinded  coffee in a small normal small steel blender. Size more than a salt and less then a sugar works well. 
3. Keep cold water in a utensil next to the stove. 
4. Fill the meticulously clean Moka pot with coffee, hot water in the lower chamber, and put on the stove with medium flame. 
5. Wait for the sound of gur gur and immediately lift the Moka pot with a wet cloth, without caring to cut the gas as in those few seconds one can over-brew the coffee and put it in the cold water to stop the brewing. 
6. Wait for 10 Seconds, fill the cup. Keep the coffee ground as manure for the wild Algerian ivy. Go and smell a flower or something else first before having the coffee and then looking over the mountains and long pine trees cherish the morning brew.   


Now I wish to upgrade my coffee game and humbly seek the advice and suggestions of the more experienced and knowledgable coffee lovers and brewers alike. Your suggestions and advice will be highly appreciated.   


1. Should I buy a hand grinder. What hand grinder shall I buy? is the Instacup hand grinder any good?   

2. Should I buy the Bialetti Moka pot or the one I have, which looks exactly like Bialetti moka pot will produce the same quality. It seems to be a simple machine.   

3. I am using AKIO, 100% Arabica beans. Since I am developing my taste. To me it taste well. But if I am to further enhance my grasp of what is a good taste. What will you recommend?

I recently had a mind-blowing experience at Cafe Coffee Day, and I can't help but think it's one of the most underrated coffee spots out there. 🤩☕

Surprisingly, I dare say it even beats what you get at big-name outlets like Starbucks and Tim Hortons. Maybe it's the charm of an underdog, but there's something about the simplicity and quality at Cafe Coffee Day that's hard to find elsewhere. ☕❤️

I read through few posts but really didnt get an answer am looking.  So posting my question here !

I like black coffee and when visited Coorg/Chikmangular last year and have picked up South Indian Filter to make black coffee at home. I got the Arabica / Robusta coffee beans grind from one of coffee plantation , so really dont know the grind size. It looks coarse to me but I realised these terms only on this sub :) Now . I can drink the coffee decoction straight from the south indian filter coffee  without even need to mix it with water or milk.

Naive  question- now am looking for  recommendation on where to go next from here - I want a stronger coffee taste at home , something like espresso , without spending too much on an espresso machine upfront! I was looking at Moka Pot on Amazon , is that a good next step to get a stronger bitter espresso-like coffee at home?  Does a machine needs a separate grinder?

I was looking at Bialetti , but it is aluminium made , so .. not sure about it now. Is areopress better in terms of beginner ? I dont need one for travel , but at home!

I am currently using a Espro P0. Its excellently designed; but has a drawback  – it retains some amount of coffee. I know this is by design and in fact, I do get gritless coffee. However, this becomes an issue when the quantity you brew is below a certain threshold. For instance, I brew at a time around 100ml coffee. (In fact, I went for P0 because of its size). So, when I pour the coffee out from the press, I get only half of it. The other half is still tucked inside :)  Everytime I open the cap and pour out the remaining and with this, I get the grit :D. So, even though P0 is excellent, it is not designed for lesser brews.  


So,  I am looking for a replacement. Can you please suggest some french press options that have the following features:  
\- Preferably around 350ml. (I can also manage 500 ml)  
\- Non-glass body  
\- decent mesh (I know it will not be as good as P0).  


I think Aeropress Go fits these specs. But anyways thought of asking in case there are other good options around the same price.

I’m a working professional, and need two good cups of coffee a day. Considering that, AeroPress gives great taste as well as it’s very low maintenance. I could brew coffee tasting cafe-like. Can anyone suggest do I really need an espresso machine now? Also, if yes, is there any recommendations around 20k?

Would really appreciate if you could take out few minutes to reply.

Much thanks in advance for replying.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/16dusvr/do_i_really_need_an_espresso_machine_when_im/

I'm a grad student and the machine is used by a handful of grad students and profs in our department. There isn't enough solidarity among us to buy things like a good precision basket, a distributor tool, a good weighing machine or even one of those good tamps. For more than a year I brewed pre-grounded coffee and while I love espresso, I knew I wanted better. Over time I've bought a weighing machine and a Timemore manual grinder and tried to improve my puck prep. I've heard people say that every coffee is different and you need to find the correct dose, and an appropriate grind size to get a balanced non-astringent cup of espresso (with let's say a fixed output-to-input ratio). I was finally able to actually experience this, somewhat consistently, for Kaffa Cerrado's Nicaraguan coffee. The espresso shot has this sublime sweetness to it which only gets better towards the end of the shot, I can actually taste notes of salted caramel through the middle while there is a strong citrus flavor in the top layer.   


Dose: 19g   
Grind size: Timemore C3 - 7 clicks  
Ratio: 2.2:1

Made coffee for the first time yesterday.  
Grinder: 1zpresso J-Max, Kettle: Fellow stagg stove top with thermometer on top

In all attempts, I pre-heat flair 58 to medium setting, and when I pour water into it, it sizzles :/  
Attempt 1:  
Coffee: Blue tokai Kalledevarapura //medium roast  
Amount: 19 grams  
Water temp: In the red-range on the thermometer  
Amount of water: Filled to the brim, then pulled liver to the top, then filled to the brim again

Grinder setting: rotated 1.5.0 counter-clockwise //didn't read instructions  
and the grind was so coarse that hot water went straight through the filter thingie into the cup and the pressure gauge didn't even register any pressure  


Result: Satan serves coffee that bitter at the hell-entrance  


Attempt 2:  
Coffee, amount, water temp and amount of water same as above  
Grinder setting: tried to find the zero by rotating anti-clockwise, then rotated 1.5.0 clockwise  
//it was super tough to grind, though I am pretty skinny, idk why anyone would do that to themselves  
Grind was pretty fine  
Result: Same bitter coffee//almost I think but at least the pressure gauge moved this time, I managed to move it at around 3 atm pressure  


Attempt 3:  
Coffee: Blue tokai silver oak  
Amount: 11 grams  
Water temp and amount: Same as above two  
Grinder setting: Tried to find zero again, where the lever doesn't move on its own by rotating anti-clockwise, then rotated 1.4.5 clockwise //still very very very tough to grind   
Result: Less bitter coffee, way less bitter than the above two attempts, while the bitterness rating on this coffee is 2/4 , and on the above coffee bean is 1/4   
I managed to pull the pressure in espresso range  


Yes, I did try to look at some tutorials, but I thought it would be better to try hands-on as well, I couldn't find how much coffee and water I should use for one shot of espresso, would really help if you guys could guide me, also if my grinder setting should be modified

**Equipment**

* Hario V60 pour over (Porcelain or clear plastic)
* V60 range server
* Gooseneck Kettle
* V60 filter papers unbleached (brown ones)

**Recipe**

* 32 grams dark roast coffee, Dhak Blend (ground slightly more course than normal)
* Water temperature ≈ 90°C
* Brewing ratio- 70 + 110 : 90 + 90 + 90
* Standard brewing time, stopped at 4:00
* Shake/stir for a good minute (to lose heat)
* 200-220 grams large ice cubes

Started with french press, then moved on to aeropress and then started using a v60. Now back to aeropress.

Recipe
15 grams coffee.
Ground at about the same size as v60. (16-18 clicks on c2)
Water-250 grams about 15-20 seconds off boil ( just wait for it to stop bubbling)
Method inverted.
Steps -
Invert aeropress.add ground coffee. Add 250 grams of coffee. Stir for about 10 seconds using a stick or a fork in back and forth and circular motions. Basically just mix it well. I use 2 filter papers and rinse them beforehand. Place cap on aeropress and let sit for 4 mins.
Flip at 4 mins, swirl it so that coffee stuck to plunger falls in the brew slurry. Let it sit for 1-2 mins. can wait longer if u want. Plunge slowly all the way through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/16jgmzl/my_new_favourite_coffee_recipe_using_aeropress/

I've been a long-time fan of instant coffee, but I recently decided to take the plunge into the world of ground coffee. After a week of research, I settled on the Dhak blend from Blue Tokai. My grand plan was to kick things off with a cold brew.

I thought I'd be smart and ask the barista at Blue Tokai for their cold brew recipe. But let me tell you, that barista turned out to be a real coffee catastrophe. They suggested I mix the entire 250g bag of Dhak blend with just 1.25 liters of water. 

So off I went to the market, got myself a 1.5-liter mason jar, and followed the advice. Well, let's just say the result was more like coffee mud than the delightful cold brew I had envisioned.

Not one to give up easily, I made another market run, this time picking up a 3-liter jar. I transferred my coffee mixture, added more water, and patiently stashed it in the fridge to brew for a full 24 hours.

The next day, bursting with excitement, I eagerly reached for my concoction, ready to enjoy a refreshing Vietnamese cold brew. But fate had other plans for me. The jar slipped from my grasp, shattering all my dreams along with it.

So, here I am, nursing my shattered jar and dreams, sharing my coffee journey with all of you. If anyone has tips for making the perfect cold brew, please share. I could use some expert advice after this caffeine catastrophe!

Cheers to coffee adventures, even if they end in a bit of a mess! ☕😅",https://i.redd.it/y7ojff0a8apb1.jpg

I was at Manipal Hospital, Varthur Road (bangalore) and they have a small outlet of 3rd Wave Coffee and after some bad news from the doctor, I thought why not try a cup of coffee. I asked the barista for Vienna Roast (Aeropress) and asked if I could see him make it, being a fellow aeropress owner I wanted to see what recipe he uses and all. The guy was super friendly and he brought his tools to my table and made it infront of me, and was explaining what is the aeropress, who made it and why. He was very knowledgeable and I would say it was one of my best (in my few) experiences. He even shared his recipe with me, although I could see his scale, so that didn't matter much. The unfortunate thing is I don't have any photos.

Earlier, I'd have two black coffees a day and end up with acidity, but this 1 milk + 1 black routine is helping a lot.

For my milk coffee, I buy Aranya Gold arabica (Hunkal Heights) which is quite cheap at 700 per kilo. I was wondering if it makes sense to blend it with a nice robusta, for added flavour and an increase in caffeine content.

I can see the following options online:

* Naivo 50/50 arabica/robusta blend @ 650/kg
* Naivo 60/40 blend @ 750/kg
* Hunkal Heights Tiger Reserve 80/20 blend @ 600/kg

Pure robusta is available from Marcs, Estate Monkeys, Tramways and Black Baza but the price makes no sense to me. Ideally robusta should be cheaper since the plants are much easier to maintain and have a good yield. I don't want to spend too much on a coffee when I'm going to add milk and dull the flavour anyway.

So if someone could suggest a well priced pure robusta, or a good option for a blend, that would be awesome, thanks in advance :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/16ni0rv/robusta_recommendations/

since then, I am trying to find a similar coffee in India, but no matter how 'branded' and expensive coffees I try out, they are miles behind the Rwanda coffee.

A little background : I consider myself a coffee aficionado, I own lot of brewing equipments and have gathered good knowledge over years.  Last year i visited Vietnam and the coffee there, OMG it just ruined every other coffee for me, Robusta has quite some kick and an amazing aftertaste that i can't get off from quite literally. Since coming back i've tried almost every robusta on offer in India (BT, Billi Hu, Mountain Brewed, 3rd culture & Diwans too) but nothing even remotely matches to the original thing (Diwans maybe but that is 1200 INR / 250 gms) So what i took matter into my own hands and went on researching, contacting and vetting coffee companies in Ho Chi Minh, I found a good one that not only produces coffee but also runs a cafe and they were quite helpful with the whole process. I ordered 10 Kgs of their top tier specialty 100% robusta and it came home finally i have my fix. 

Goal : I am not gonna mark up anything on the price, my landing price was 600 INR / 250 gms as shipping cost itself was more than the value of coffee itself. What I am really interested is in finding two or three fellows like me who can pitch in along with me on repeat orders every two months. So I am just doing these post for people like me who have tried or want to try the 'Authentic Vietnamese Robusta'. Anything less than 10 Kg is not feasible as the shipping costs are wild and make a significant impact on my landing price. (for 5kg order the landing price increases to almost 1000 INR /250 gms)

About the Coffee

* Single Origin 100% Specialty Robusta
* Medium Dark Roasted in last week on Aug 2023 
* Tasting Notes :  Bold, bitter, fruity, syrupy and a hint of chocolate with a persistent aftertaste
* Grind : Made for 'Phin Filter' specially, also works great in 'Moka Pot'
* Packaging : 250 gms individual packets with one way degassing valve (the back side has detailed 'Phin Filter' brewing instructions with pictures) These individual packets are good for one year unopened.

Vienna, Italian and French roasts, to be specific. That taste of char and tobacco just clicked so well together; I wouldn’t have it any other way.

It’s been over five years since I quit, and now I find the dark roasts I once favoured to be not my cup of Joe anymore. That charred flavour doesn’t work for my palette anymore.

I now prefer my cup with milk, Almond or Lactose-Free. 

No sugar, of course, still. Lord no.

When the acidity is on the higher side, it doesn’t work well with the milk, IMHO, so I know I do not necessarily prefer fruity or acidic profiles.

Bitter is fine as long as the coffee is not overshadowed by too much bitterness. 

I now have a more sensitive palette and want to experience various estates for their origin characteristics but estates and roasts that fit my general preferences.

I still want a full-bodied, balanced cup as well. Thick and velvety.

For equipment, I’m using the JX Pro, a Bosch Cordless Drill and a Flair 58.

The grinder recommendation for espresso range is around 15clicks. But my shot choaked & straightaway channeled on my first attempt.

Have been using  BT silver oak cafe blend (med roast). I have been going more finer & finer.

Now at 20clicks, got rid of choaking & got into proper flow rate. Still its channeling & coffee tastes so bitter. The shot drip also seems to start very late, where as I shouldve typically seen the drip by end ofpre infusion (8 pumps).

Theoretically you would go more finer, but the clicks are wayy away from practically what everyones using. Also my grinding is kind of difficult & gets stuck between rotations, opposed to everyone doing it so smooth on videos.

2. What can one do as a consumer? Can one, for instance, avoid purchasing produced in Kodagu (if at all that’s even possibly to identify coffee like that).  Is it even possible to do anything?

Should I wash the the coffee grinder first before using it? How often should it be washed? Is it okay if I just brush out the retained coffee (picked up some Hoffman lingo lol)? 
Any new beans you think i should try? 
Is the grinder really that big a deal or should i manage my expectations?

I have been toying with the idea of buying beans instead of ground coffee and grinding them myself. Reasons: coffee stays fresher, can customise my grind to the coffee maker and also the grinding can be a good ritual. 

Questions for folks who use manual grinder - 

1. Would it easily give me grinds for Aeropress and mocha pot or French press?
2. Time and effort it normally takes to grind for a cuppa; don’t want it to become a chore that takes away the pleasure.

 The price range is huge, but since its long term, dont want to get something and not enjoy.

My current setup

* Moka Pot
* Timemore U French Press (Gift)
* Shaze Pour - over Setup (Gift)

I have been buying preground beans from different roasters. but I know I haven't been able to extract full flavor because of that.

So what should be a good pick.

Considerations

* Investing for long term
* need different ground sizes
* usage is twice a day

Thanks to this community, I am even planning to move to a espresso machine, but that's not until next year.

I let it steep for 2 mins before extracting slowly, not sure if the grinds had an issue but I required a lot more pressure than usual to extract the coffee and could not even completely plunge till the end.

Coming to the coffee itself, It tasted so much different from Arabica, Robusta gave me a nice kick in terms of caffeine which I always like in my morning coffee, but the more cacao type notes were the best part.

I just wanted to share my recent experience with a Cafe JEI French press that I purchased a few month ago after I saw one in sale on amazon (Don't fall for their high rating).

The French press was marketed as having a heat-resistant glass carafe, but when I poured hot water into it, the carafe cracked right before my eyes. I was incredibly disappointed, as this clearly wasn't what I had expected.

What's even more frustrating is the lack of customer service from Cafe JEI. I've been trying to contact them via email for over a week now, but I haven't received a single reply. They did reply on Instagram when I inquired about their Aeropress, but the moment I mentioned the issue with my French press, they stopped responding there as well.

I've had much better experience with instacuppa when the same thing happened and they were quick on providing an exchange as it was under warranty.

Last year i found my perfect brew Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 method for pour over. If you haven't tried it yet, you're in for a treat!

**Why it stands out**: This method emphasizes the separation of flavors during brewing. By adjusting the amount of water used in each pour, you can extract a range of flavors from the beans, resulting in a cup that's both rich and nuanced.

&#x200B;

**Pouring technique**:

* **First Pour**: Pour 40% of the water. This saturates the coffee grounds and encourages blooming. Wait for 45 seconds.
* **Second Pour**: Pour up to 60% of the total water in 10-15 seconds. Wait for 45 seconds.
* **Third Pour**: Pour up to 80%. Wait for 45 seconds.
* **Fourth Pour**: Pour the remaining 20%.

**Why I love it**: The beauty of this method is in its versatility. By tweaking the amount of water in each pour, you can accentuate different flavor profiles from your beans. For me, this has consistently given a cup that's balanced, with a clear distinction between bitterness, acidity, and sweetness.

 Besides it's become a ritual for me to do a pulsed pour first thing every morning. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For those who've tried this, what's been your experience? And if you haven't, give it a shot and let me know how it goes! Happy brewing!

If any of you have successfully made this switch, I’d love to hear your advice. How did you adjust to the taste of black coffee? Are there specific beans or something you’d recommend for a smoother transition?

Looking forward to your insights! Thanks in advance! ☕️",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/17ccfx1/making_the_switch_from_instant_milk_coffee_to/

1. *What is the coffee to water ratio you use?*   
I have tried 1:15 & 1:10 and enjoyed 1:15 more. 1:10 taste more on the bitter side. But then, I brewed 1:10 for around 20 hours while 1:15 was brewed for 18 hours so it could be that too.
2. *How many hours do you brew it for?*   
I brew it for atleast 15-18 hrs. Noticed that brewing for more than that brings out the bitter taste and ruins it.
3. *Where do you leave it to brew?*  
 I refrigerate, every single time. Have heard that you can brew it faster outside but yet to try that.
4. *What do you brew into?*   
I use the household jar. I don't have the fancy Mizudashi jar, although it looks cool.
5. *Do you use a airtight jar?*  
I don't have one so I cling wrap it or just use a plate to cover the top.

So, this has a bit of history.

Beginner home brewer looking for a coffee subscription service which sends me small packs (maybe 75-100gm) of different coffees every month. Most of the services I saw start from 200/250gm packs minimum. I don't drink so much coffee and I'm only brewing for myself so a 250gm pack usually lasts me 3-4 weeks easy. I would rather have smaller packs which I can try over the month to get a hold of my flavour and roast preferences.

I usually brew Espresso (Wacaco Picopresso) or Filter coffee (South Indian Filter), in case this info helps in any way.

Does anyone know of any such subscription box service available? If not, would you be interested in one? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/17ljz8x/coffee_sampler_service_recommendations/

1. For aeropress if 90c is recommended, how does one measure it without a thermometer? specifically for kettle? when it starts making noise then 5.5 mins?
2. Differently brewing coffee or different coffees altogether taste different but can they give different ""highs""? 
3. I bought aeropress grind attikan from BT 4 days back, used it twice. Ideally how quickly should one aim to finish a packet? The smell of coffee seemingly went fainter within a day or two.. If yes, does that mean aeropress folks (without a grinder) buy and keep one packet at a time?

Price: ₹14000

Reason: Upgraded to the Flair 58

Please note:

1. You NEED a grinder for this. If it's a hand grinder or electric, make sure it can handle espresso grinds. The Flair Classic is a bit forgiving in the sense you can go slightly coarser than, say, you can with the Flair 58, which I upgraded to, mainly because it uses a narrower portafilter. 
2. A gooseneck kettle will make filling the chamber 1000 times more manageable.
3. It would be best if you preheated the chamber using a sieve on top of your kettle and heated it by steam or boiling it in water. 
4. The Flair Classic is fantastic for a few reasons. If you take the time to learn about espresso, you can pull some espresso shots that can compete with machines that cost thousands of dollars. Because the process is manual, you can profile and control multiple aspects like pressure and flow rate by hand. The satisfaction it provides is something else.
5. The Flair Classic is excellent if you take your time and master making espresso, one shot at a time. A Flair 58 could be better if you want to pull several shots one after another.

This is portable, only needs hot water wherever you go, it has electronics that can break, and it is built to last. As such, you're buying a tool. What you get out of it, though, is entirely up to you and your willingness to nail the perfect shot. I am happy to help you get your feet off the ground if you buy this from me.

so i have managed to get a bottomless portafilter working with a morphy richards kaffeto. The machine itself is awesome - it does espresso and capuccino pretty damn well.

Please morphy richards service is quite decent.

the way to do the portafilter is this - u need to trip it using a small hand file. This is about 30-40 mins of work. And the portafilter will look a bit scuffed from the side. You can definitely polish it up again using a sandpaper...but it works well.

You need a 51mm Delonghi EC680 EC685 compatible portafilter. Now the ""ears"" of the portafilter wont fit. They are too long + too thick + too wide.

you need to :

1. slope them like the morphy richards one (this is the easiest to do. dont care about precision cos as long as it slopes...it will slide in and lock)
2. make them thinner (this takes the maximum time)
3. make it less wide. This is the one which is non obvious, but causes the most issues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/17oho8u/success_morphy_richards_kaffeto_with_a_bottomless/

&#x200B;

1. Is there such a thing as 'bru coffee' in the menus of restaurants/cafes in India? Or is it referred by a different name in India. In my country, 'bru coffee' is sold in Indian restaurants. I understand that this type of coffee is generally brewed from instant coffee with chicory (usually the Bru brand by Unilver) with fresh milk and sometimes with sugar as well. 
2. Since 'bru coffee' is technically instant coffee with chicory and milk, is there any cafe that makes this type of coffee but with actual beans (like specialty or single origin Arabicas)? If yes, do you blend with chicory as well? The reason why I'm asking is because I love Indian cuisine, and I love to drink bru coffee. But ever since getting deeper into the rabbit hole of third wave coffee, I've been wondering if there is anyone making 'bru coffee' but without using instant coffee.

I want it to taste similar to the coffee at Rameshwaram Cafe, Sendhoor Coffee, and other spots in Bangalore. Try as I might, I have been unable to replicate the specific intensity, bite, and thickness that South Indian filter coffee has. I think the three problem areas are: (1) the preparation method (2) the brewing apparatus and (3) the coffee grounds. 

I've tried coffee grounds such as Cothas and Malgudi, both 80-20 coffee-chicory splits. Initially, I thought the issue was that I needed more chicory, but the nice people at Sendhoor showed a packet of the grounds they use. [Cothas Premium Blend](https://cothas.com/products/premium-special-home-blend), 80-20 split. So I don't think the issue lies with my coffee grounds.

I use a small, [basic filter](https://www.amazon.in/Shoponwheelz-South-Indian-Filter-Coffee/dp/B09QQ2KGWY). I use about 4 teaspoons of coffee powder for a single mug of coffee (a big mug, not a small traditional cup). I heat water and let it cool for about 40-50 seconds after it boils, and slowly pour the hot water over the plunger in the filter. I do not specifically measure the amount of water I pour, enough to fill about 1/3rd of the top chamber of the filter. I recognize this is not a scientific measurement and has poor reproducibility.   
I heat milk, mixing sugar in while it's the stove and removing the heat as soon as the milk begins to rise. I then simply pour the milk over the decoction until I reach a good, filter coffee-like color. 

This coffee almost always turns out to be sad. While it does taste similar to the coffee at cafes, the typical Bangalore coffee ""bite"" is not intense enough. The coffee does not have a rich flavor and ends  up rather watery. 

I've experimented and varied the coffee-water ratio with limited success. My decoction almost never comes out to be as thick and strong as the decoction in cafes. I'd appreciate it if a seasoned filter coffee veteran can give me exact measurements of how much of each ingredient to use.

I recognize that it may be impossible to perfectly replicate the flavor of coffee in restaurants because of the inferior filter I'm using. Nonetheless, I would like to come as close as possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/17pq4o2/need_help_with_creating_the_perfect_filter_coffee/

As I embark on my exploration of specialty coffee brewing, I seek the expertise of this community to guide me in selecting a coffee that aligns with my discerning palate. The intricacies of coffee notes listed on packaging have presented a challenge, prompting my appeal for informed recommendations.

1. Starbucks Sumatra Single Origin (Dark Roast)
2. Blue Tokai's Attikan Estate
3. Blue Tokai Baarbara Estate

In my recent experience with KC Roasters Melkodige Natural Medium Roast Coffee, I found the pronounced cherry notes to be less to my liking. It appears that my palate gravitates towards the allure of chocolaty and earthy undertones.

1.  A Timemore C3 grinder, an aeropress and relevant filters, 250 ml coffee mug,  100 mg coffee beans in a metal can 

OR  

2. A Timemore C3 grinder, Hario V 60 dripper and relevant filters, 250 ml coffee mug, 100 mg coffee beans in a metal can 

So it would  be great to hear your suggestions and recommendations. 

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/17th48m/suggestions_for_a_travel_case_for_coffee_equipment/

My observations of the above beans are .
Bluetokai - smooth, less bitter, good taste, low caffeine.
Cothas and 7000 - moderate bitter, less tasteful, low caffeine.
Rage (90:10) - more bitter, less taste,more caffeine.

Since I bought a 500g of rage coffee it lasted me about 2-3 months. Ps. I take only 5-6 coffee per week.

&#x200B;

I have started loving coffee for the past 3-4 years. My favorite is the filter coffee. My Wife recently gifted me a Drip Coffee Machine (Agaro) for my birthday along with the BlueTokai (Vienna Roast) Medium Grind.

&#x200B;

I get some amazing Black Coffee from the machine but somehow there seems to be some minute coffee powder dust that seeps into the the drink. 

&#x200B;

1. Is this normal with drip coffee machines?
2. What's the ideal grind size for such machines.
3. Is there any roaster better than Blue Tokai in India?
4. I observed that if i don't remove the grounds from yesterday, i seem to get a stronger coffee for the same amount of powder probably because in the cone filter thanks to old grounds it get spread more evenly.

I am getting a very acidic taste in my extracted coffee so far. The profile for this coffee does say 3/4 in acidity and 1/4 in bitterness, so it might just be the coffee. 

Current method I am using:

1. 18g of coffee, grind size: 12 clicks on Timemore C2 (its a light roast)
2. inverted aeropress
3. 50ml of water at around 95c, bloom for 20 seconds
4. stir rapidly 10 times
5. 150ml more water (total 200ml), with stirring 5 times
6. put the filter and cap in, push out the air
7. let it immerse for 2.5 mins
8. inverted and plunged slowly

Should I maybe increase the immersion time, to say 4 minutes?

50K budget is just for the machine. I’m getting the C3 Esp grinder (this variant has finer grind size adjustments for espresso) from my friend in the US. 

I think machines in this price range all have tradeoffs and I can’t make up my mind. 

- GCP: needs 1) OPV mod which I understand is relatively easy to do, 2) no PID, needs temperature surfing for good shots, which I’m not sure how easy it is to achieve 

- Lelit Anna PID: slightly more expensive, but has a 57mm group head. I.e. limited accessories eventually. The tamper apparently doesn’t push the ground down since the shape of the basket is tapered and not flat. Also slightly above budget 

- Bambino: over budget. Seems like longevity might be an issue 

- Budan: No trust, seems like cheap Chinese re-brands 

- Solis Perfetta: only refurb in budget. I like milk drinks and thermoblock seems like it’ll be an issue for that

Approaching the end of my Monsoon Malabar pack, I've discovered that my preference leans heavily toward unflavored coffee.

I bought the Taparia vice grip, a flathead screwdriver and a Phillips 0 screwdriver - all from Amazon. 

The replacement M2 burr from Blue tokai. 

First, open the outer case with the flathead screwdriver. 

Second, unscrew wing nut, remove burr holder. 

Now, lock in vice grip and hit it hard. This is the tricky part. Follow the instructions from this [video](https://youtu.be/rfCP-BVTGOg?si=D1yMmlDfx-Duvrr2) 

Before using the vice grip, make sure you learn how to properly lock it by following [this video](https://youtu.be/s53TSR_qOmE?si=aJuR-VjhWWjDBv3z).  


The results are just amazing. 

Now grinding takes less time and goes much finer and the grinder is also quieter.

I have a Gaggia Magenta Prestige Milk at office and it does a decent job but I'm wondering if shelling out some more money and getting a more premium option is worth it for the home. A manual or semi-automatic isn't my cup of tea.

Machines I am currently considering are the Saeco Xelsis Deluxe, Gaggia Academia 2023, both are at the same price point with Caramelly. Some other machines at lower price points that I have taken a look at would be the DeLonghi Dinamica Plus and some of the other Gaggia machines in and around that price. 

If I understand correctly, none of the brands other are DeLonghi are officially present in India, they are all sold and serviced through various partners/resellers. DeLonghi is handled by Orient Electric AFAIK. But Gaggia and Saeco seem to have decent availability in terms of spares and service in India, atleast that is what it seems as opposed to some of the other brands like Jura.

I like to put milk in my coffee. As someone who’s transitioning from instant coffee to SIF, the taste difference compared to instant coffee is clearly noticeable. SIF is very rich and strong. However, I have some doubts regarding the dripping time.

Is the dripping (or extraction) time affected by the chicory blend used? Because initially, I used Bru Green Label (53% coffee and 47% chicory), and it took up to 15 minutes to get the full decoction. But yesterday, I used Continental Malgudi (80% and 20%). However, after 15 minutes, I got way less decoction than the Bru one. Am I doing something wrong, or what?

Also, generally, after the decoction is fully collected in the lower chamber, I’m busy at the time. So what do I do to keep the decoction without over-extracting? Like suppose if I want to add that decoction to milk after an hour or two after it’s fully collected?

Please suggest your best ratios and extraction time 😊. Any other tips regarding SIF are appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/18crh07/south_indian_filter_cofee_lovers/

I had tried Pahadee Coffee Roasters' Latte Blend earlier and while I liked it, I had probably asked them to grind it for a steeping brew rather than a moka pot so the extraction wasn't really good. I went with the Moka Pot House blend this time and it turned out to be great. 

I made two drinks out of a single batch - a latte and an americano (1:1). The americano was refreshing - tasted nutty (but not the burnt kind) and chocolaty with some sweetness to it. Acidity was medium-ish, bitterness not a lot and mostly in the base brew. I loved the latte I made with this, the chocolatiness was intensified and the flavour became very well rounded and balanced. I did not add any sugar to mine. The best part was the aftertaste it left, that has been my problem with most coffees and was fortunately not the case with this one. 

The shipping did take some time, I had ordered it around the 3rd and it arrived on the 7th of December. Also, the packaging does not mention the particular estates/kinds of beans used. 

I have also ordered their Gemblary Estate Dual Fermented coffee, will be trying that out as well.

u/FieryStorm,Marc's Decaf Review,4,2023-12-15 16:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/18ixsbv/marcs_decaf_review/,"Lots of people here have recommended Marc's decaf as the only Indian (and relatively cheap) whole bean decaf option. There wasn't much information about it though, so I've decided to write a short review.

(Pic#2 is some grounds I pulled out of the brew, pic#3 is the filtered out microfines to show how darkly roasted it is)

TL;DR: Yes it's actually decaf - no it's not worth it (burnt beans) - would only recommend if you're into very dark roasts. Use immersion brews to get the best of the beans if you're stuck with them.

Longer version:

The coffee is definitely decaf: I drank just this for one whole day and caffeine crashed at the end of the day pretty hard.

The first time I ground up the beans at home my mom literally shouted from the other room, ""What's burning!!???¿"" The first few brews were small pourovers at very coarse grind size (12g, 5.7 setting on the ZP6). Extremely burnt flavors, bitter. Next I tried cupping it, that was better. Immersion is definitely the way to brew this coffee. Since I was stuck with a bag of these beans I decided to experiment and come up with a good recipe for any of y'all who may also be in a similar position.

My recommended recipe is very coarse grind size, 75g/L immersion at ~80°C and moderate agitation. I personally use 58-60 clicks on the ZP6; I'm not sure how much that is for the Time More C2, but should be above 30 clicks. My french press technique is Hoffmann's, which is basically your standard cupping technique, but at the end I filter out the microfines with a v60 cloth filter.

I've attached a few pics to show the grind size and the microfines in the cloth filter. You definitely want to filter those out, because they're VERY bitter and don't add any body. The flavor profile has * some * nutty and chocolatey notes, and the body is good. There's zero acidity, and only a lil bit of sweetness.

All in all, this coffee isn't worth it. I'm used to dark roasts (mostly robusta), but this is something else entirely. Would not recommend.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18ixsbv

- Boil the water separately first, add it to the bottom compartment.

- Assemble the moka pot and put it on stovetop. Wait for the coffee to start percolating into the top compartment, immediately lower the flame to sim.

- As soon as the coffee starts gurgling, stop the flame and put the pot under cold water.

Coffee: Blue Tokai Seethergundu Estate- Light, it’s a light roast coffee(though disappointingly unevenly roasted) with printed tasting notes of Orange, Peach and Black Tea.

Technique: I usually make my v60 using James Hoffmann 1 cup v60 technique, so I used the same for this to be able to tell the difference.

Results: 

Normal James Hoffmann(Control) -

Tastes fruity/acidic and has a little sweet after taste but unable to taste Black tea. Can taste a little peach at times (I don’t have that enhanced of a palette to tell every notes)


With Marble drip -

Black tea is the dominant taste with fruitiness subdued but over all very balanced cup, less sweeter than normal technique also the normal cup is a bit more dynamic, it can have a little varied taste every sip but this wasn’t the case with Marble drip, it was uniform throughout. Although I haven’t tried any flat bottom brewer but I have a hunch that this is what it would taste like.

I know certain posts were reported that might have appeared to be promotional, but they may also be reviews rather than promotions. This alone could be a reason why some of them were not removed. 

The owners and founders of different brands/cafes have a history of actively promoting on this subreddit. Even after I have repeatedly called and blocked them, and occasionally even given them another chance to refrain from using this subreddit for promotion purposes. They have even send me direct messages mentioning I'm doing this to gatekeep and damage their brand. 

I am just a person who drinks two cups of coffee a day and is always on the look for different roasters to try, I have nothing to do with any brand. 

During the C@ffena saga and their two years of astroturfing here in r/indiacoffee, and us calling them and their employees out, all that happened was that the post was removed and reddit admin issued a warning. Since then, we have stopped calling people/brands out and have removed posts/comments based on reports and user history.

In order for promotional posts/comments to appear on our moderator feed, we request that you report any posts or comments that can be construed as promotions, so we can remove them asap. 

If you have any suggestion, feature or insight, that you would like this subreddit to have then kindly DM me.

I've recently been using the Wacaco Nanopresso with the Agaro Manual grinder to make espresso, but I've been encountering an issue with the espresso turning out a bit watery. I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this or has any tips to improve the espresso quality.

I've been following the recommended steps, using fresh coffee beans and grinding them with the Agaro Manual grinder to a fine consistency. However, despite my efforts, the resulting espresso seems a bit watery compared to what I expected.

One particular issue I've noticed is that when the grind setting is at level 1 (very fine), the coffee powder ends up in the cup, affecting the overall quality. Currently, I've adjusted the grinder to level 2 to prevent this issue.

I've experimented with different coffee bean types, grind sizes, and tamping pressures, but the issue persists. Could it be related to the grinder, the brewing process, or something else entirely?

I'd love to hear from anyone who has experience with the Wacaco Nanopresso or the Agaro Manual grinder and has tips or suggestions on how to achieve a richer and more flavorful espresso.

I always used to put my coffee bags on counter top, away from sunlight & warmth, knowing the one-way valve & ziplock was sufficient. 

But this KCroasters lock thing was finicky, my first bag produced bad shot after 2weeks. So for this specifically I bought an air tight container for the 2nd bag & kept locked whole bag inside inside it after every use.

This 2nd bag was ratnagiri & this coffee demanded lungo type(1:2.5). It took me days to figure out the flow rate first. Then I kept working till I came close, coffee seemed balanced, but little sourness & shot was fast by 2seconds.

So knew upping dose by 0.5g will definetly fix everything. Waited for my final brew of the bag & did everything perfectly. Boom coffee was justt shity fast by 8secs & shot was so watery tea like.

This was same as my first bag. That air tight container seem to made no difference.

I know Hoffmann has given it a [bad review](https://youtu.be/GeI9DHf1Vkw?t=542), but I've made a few tweaks to it, and have been getting good brews. Read ahead to find out what these tweaks are.

I'm not using the metal mesh filter, just the cone with a v60 cloth filter. Since it's metal it needs a bit of preheating for light roasts, but apart from that it's great. What I'm most interested about is how it functions as a no/low bypass cone brewer, similar to a mugen.

While Hoffmann is very critical about the stalling issue (the filter sticks to the wall), I actually like this. The flow rate is reduced to a crawl - I've circled the stream of water in the second pic. You can let the coffee infuse for a long time, as if you've closed the switch in a Hario switch. If you want to restart the flow, or want a faster brew, just shove a chopstick into the cone till the bottom (third pic). It's just that easy.

Overall, I'd recommend this cone to people who don't want to spend upwards of 4k on a switch. I initially didn't expect it to be able to work like a switch; I got it just because it's metal and has good longevity. But now I love having this extra functionality as well.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18r4ydf

1.  Does wetting your filter paper with hot water (before putting the ground coffee) make a difference to how your coffee tastes?

2. Does one filter paper feel better over the other in terms of taste?  I use two  the Hario size 02 natural / brown colour and also the smaller size 01 white colours. 

To me the natural feels better but it’s early days yet.  Haven’t experimented enough 

3. This is important but slightly hard for me to explain:

Hoffman method water pouring ratio - I’m trying to figure out the ratio of water to be poured in terms of percentages- how much for the bloom, then the first pour and then the second one?   If the first pour is 60 % and second 40%, as some sites say, how does one account for the water for the bloom?  In the 60 percent?

4. Also Hoffmann method,  how much time is it taking you to finish the process? I’m taking broadly 1 minute and 30 seconds tops.  But fear that it’s too fast. 
 
5. I’m using a C3 grinder - can anyone with a C3 talk to what clicks they’re on for pour over?

 I started with the recommended 17 but that looked too fine/ espresso like.  I have  have gone to 21 clicks.  Now it’s looking like the recommended granulated Sugar. I will continue to experiment. 


6. Temperature -  I’m getting a weird feeling that my coffee tastes better as time passses while I drink it and it cools down.  Not when it’s cold, just when it’s cooler than the 90-95 degrees Celsius at the start.  Anyone else her that feeling?

7. Of the 90-95 degrees recommended brewing temperature, what temperature of extraction is working for you in terms of coffee taste? I’m still experimenting but it seems that water closer to 90 degrees seems to lead to better coffee.  Of course that could be because I prefer dark roasts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/18rum7t/dumb_questions_on_pour_over_using_v_60_part_1/
