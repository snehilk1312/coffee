Anuswaram #4,,From Rs. 600.00,https://kapikottai.coffee/products/bihag-copy,"Greenland estate, Valparai",1500m - 1737m ASL,Washed Arabica (18 hr dry- ferment),Jaggery | Peach | Floral,Medium-Light,"Anuswaram in Carnatic parlance means a note between notes and denotes complex melodic movements that rāga-s tend to employ. We sometimes receive small lots of coffee that really captivate us with their complexity or innovative processing. We feel that Anuswaram is a fitting name for featuring these intriguing offerings. The 4th in this series is a very special washed coffee from the lofty hills of Valparai. Located in the Thalanar region of the Valparai plateau, Greenland estate is spread over 200 acres and at an altitude of 1500- 1737m ASL, is one of the highest farms that we have sourced from. The owner Mr. Govind, is very eager to make inroads into the speciality coffee segment and nothing showcases what the farm has to offer like this washed lot. To prepare this, cherries of the SLN 09 varietal were picked picked ripe, pulped (i.e. skin was removed) and fermented for 18 hours. The coffee beans were  then washed  and slow dried for a fortnight on raised beds. The low temperatures(because  of the high altitude) and the care taken during processing have made this coffee an absolute delight in the cup! There's a very prominent jaggery like sweetness, a partly peachy ,  partly orange-like acidity and a whole bunch of florals, some of.which we could triangulate and some which we couldn't. All this complexity is very reminiscent of African coffees and quite uncommon in Indian offerings. We thank Mr. Viggnesh for having helped source this beautiful coffee for us and hope to work with Greenland estate more closely in future! Anuswaram #4 is a delight across all manual brews but shines best in a v60."

Kurinji,,From Rs. 610.00,https://kapikottai.coffee/products/kurinji,"Sirangalli, Coorg",1200m- 1400m ASL,Yeast inoculated Pulp sun-dried Arabica (sequentially fermented for 96 hrs),Mulberry | Molasses | Vanilla,Medium - light,"The Sirangalli Community Project is a sustainable coffee farming initiative by the South India Coffee Company (SICC) that works with small coffee farmers in the Pushpagiri Range of Coorg. These biodiverse farms range from 1 - 10 acres  and are family run operations. The lots selected for the project have been processed at Mooleh manay estate. We had featured the coffees from Sirangalli last year under our Anuswaram series and liked them enough to bring one back for this year as a perennial offering. The lot we chose from the Sirangalli set was the honey and boy did it have an interesting processing journey! Cherries of a mix of arabica varietals(SLn 06, SLn 09, Chandragiri) were picked ripe and floated to remove low density coffee. For the first fermentation step, the cherries are put in anoxic fermentation tanks and fermented for 60 hrs with a custom yeast culture. The cherries are then pulped carefully., i.e  the outer skin is removed. This process is done with a lot of care and very little water as the coffee is delicate from the fermentation. The pulped cherries are once again put in the anoxic tanks and a custom yeast culture is reintroduced, this time for 36 hrs(bringing the fermentation grand total to 96 hrs). Post fermentation,  the coffee is transferred to a controlled-environment polyhouse for drying. It's spread on raised beds to ensure even moisture removal throughout the process. Estate staff regularly turn the coffee with rakes for optimal drying. All the care taking during the extensive processing has resulted in a phenomenal cup that brims with complexity and a wonderful balance. We taste the acidity of mulberries a and a vanilla like sweetness, making this coffee very drinkable(we chugged multiple cups of this in the name of testing and throughly enjoyed every drop!). The sweet and berry like nature of this coffee reminds us of the rāga Kurinji which possesses a short and achingly sweet musical gait. Kurinji the coffee is a delight across all manual brews , especially over ice!"
Mind = Blown,,From Rs. 610.00,https://kapikottai.coffee/products/mind-blown,"Mooleh manay Estate, Coorg",1000m ASL,"Inoculated Naturals (64 hrs), Arabica",Raspberry | Pomegranate | Vanilla,Medium-Light,"Our OG best seller is back and this time ,with an update! This year's iteration of Mind=blown is a yeast inoculated natural. The folks at Mooleh Manay wanted consistency across the board with their naturals and honeys this year. Using yeast, was the best way to ensure this. For this year's lot, ripe cherries were picked and put in a floatation tank as usual to remove immatures. The cherries that sank were then put in airtight food grade barrels and a yeast culture was added. Fermentation was carefully monitored and after 64 hours the coffee was put out to dry slowly  on raised beds in a polyhouse(the new normal  thanks to unseasonal harvest rains). All this care has resulted in a coffee that is fruity but also clean and insanely sweet. We find the acidity very raspberry like and the sweetness reminds us of vanilla. We cannot state enough about how sweet and drinkable this year's iteration of mind=blown is. The coffee is very versatile and is a delight across all brews, manual (degassing time 3 days) and espresso (degassing time 14 days)."
Mōhanakalyāni,,From Rs. 520.00,https://kapikottai.coffee/products/mohanakalyani,"Krishnagiri estate, Chikmagalur",1219m- 1500m ASL,Washed Arabica,Brown sugar | Cherry | Praline,Medium,"Our sweetest washed coffee is back! Sourced from Krishnagiri estate ,high up in the Chandra drona hills(a.k.a the Giris) of Chikmagalur, this lot of washed arabica fascinated us with its bean density and versatility(traits we have come to associate with the coffee from Krishnagiri estate). Ripe cherries of the SLN 795varietal(our favourite )have been selected for this lot and the estate has tweaked their standard washed process to eke more out of the coffee. The resulting cup is very sweet and delightfully nutty with a more prominent cherry like finish compared to last year . This sugar like sweetness reminds us of the rāga Mohanakalyāni and this coffee is the new daily driver at kāpikottai HQ. Mohanakalyāni the coffee, is a delight across all manual brews and also shines as a single origin espresso."
Sahānā,,From Rs. 580.00,https://kapikottai.coffee/products/sahana,"Unakki estate, Chikmagalur",1220-1370m ASL,"Arabica naturals, Traditional",Candied Sweet lime | Plum | Almond,Medium-Light,"The good folks of Unakki estate have dabbled with more processing methods this season and we found their naturals to be the most interesting of the bunch! These are traditional naturals with no intended fermentation design. Coffee cherries have been picked ripe and slow-dried on raised beds. The resulting coffee is a curious concoction in the cup, being brighter than other naturals that we have cupped. While the aroma is decidedly fruity, the taste is in the  spectrum of Unakki 's washed coffee but with a higher intensity and a surprisingly delicate mouthfeel. We quite like these intriguing flavours and the coffee reminded our roaster of the rāga Sahānā. Sahānā the coffee is a delight across all manual brews and makes a very sweet shot of espresso after 14 days of degassing."
Sārangā,,From Rs. 520.00,https://kapikottai.coffee/products/saranga,"Madhu Agro plantation, Koraput, Odisha",920m ASL,Pulp sun-dried Arabica (Yellow honey),Bergamot | Peach | Delicate,Medium-Light,"Coffee from the Koraput is back and we have Kalinga Desi agro to thank for helping us procure this lot. This is a single varietal lot from Madhu Agro plantation, with the varietal being SLn 795(one of the oldest arabica cultivars in India). The processing is a yellow honey and really amplifies the natural sweetness of the varietal SLn 795 is out roaster's favourite Indian varietal and the famed sweetness really comes through in this lot with a hit of peach like fruitiness and a delicate mouthfeel. Sārangā the coffee is a zesty delight across all manual brewing methods though we particularly enjoy this onthr aeropress where the sweetness becomes very candy like!"

Tōdi,,From Rs. 520.00,https://kapikottai.coffee/products/todi,"Krishnagiri estate, Chikmagalur",1219m- 1500m ASL,Washed Arabica,Treacle | Walnut | Hints of Cherry,Dark,"Our newest dark roast! Sourced from Krishnagiri estate ,high up in the Chandra drona hills(a.k.a the Giris) of Chikmagalur, this lot of washed arabica fascinated us with its bean density and versatility(traits we have come to associate with the coffee from Krishnagiri estate). Ripe cherries of the SLN 795 varietal (our favourite )  have been selected for this lot and the estate has tweaked their standard washed process to eke more out of the coffee. We liked the lot so much this year that we decided to a more developed roast apart from the medium roast; taking the beans close to second crack but stopping short of that that point. This makes the coffee stand up to milk better but retains some origin character. The boldness of this coffee reminds us of the rāga tōdi and is our go to for milk based drinks. Tōdi the coffee is a delight on the espresso machine, moka pot , south-indian filter and immersion brewers like French press and Aeropress."
