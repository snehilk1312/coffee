We feel that Anuswaram is a fitting name for featuring these intriguing lots.The second in this series is a very special natural from our OG farm partner, Mooleh Manay.The estate has been experimenting with growing cultures to be used in fermentation for a couple of years and this particular lot was lot was fermented with a starter culture grown from grapes.Climate change is an unfortunate reality in today's world and this lot uses only cherries which have split or haven't ripened fully  because of unseasonal rainfall.The splits and semi ripes have been dried for a day , fermented in sealed bags using this culture and then slow dried on raised beds. The drying has been done over a fortnight inside poly tunnelsThe resulting cup is a riot of fruity flavours , chocolatey sweetness and a rose like florality. What amazed us the most about this coffee is its sweetness and drinkability. The complexity is never overbearing and the cup is 'clean' despite all the fruity flavours.Anuswaram #2 is a delight across all manual brews , especially shining as a pourover with a V60.

The owner Mr. Govind, is very eager to make inroads into the speciality coffee segment and nothing showcases what the farm has to offer like this washed lot.To prepare this, cherries of the SLN 09 varietal were picked picked ripe, pulped (i.e. skin was removed) and fermented for 18 hours. The coffee beans were  then washed  and slow dried for a fortnight on raised beds.The low temperatures(because  of the high altitude) and the care taken during processing have made this coffee an absolute delight in the cup! There's a very prominent jaggery like sweetness, a partly peachy ,  partly orange-like acidity and a whole bunch of florals, some of.which we could triangulate and some which we couldn't.

The cherries were fermented in a sealed barrel for 48 hrs, before being slow dried on raised beds.The resulting cup has always pleasantly surprised us , right from the first test roast. There is a lot of complexity and fruitiness without it being overbearing. We initially taste a muskmelon like softness and mulberry like acidity but the coffee really comes into its own 10 days post roast when a mangoey aroma takes centre stage(we ourselves were shocked when this first happened but we don't begrudge pleasant surprises). All this fruitiness is never overpowering though, the coffee always has a soft finish and is very drinkable.The mango aromas reminds us of the rāga kāmbhōji and this coffee is what we love serving to visitors at kāpikottai HQ!Kāmbhōji the coffee is a delight across all manual brews but we recommend the clever dripper or hario switch to extract the most of that mangoey goodness.We hope this Collab between the folks at Ram estate and Binny Varghese results in more amazing coffees in the coming season."

This year's iteration of Mind=blown is a yeast inoculated natural.The folks at Mooleh Manay wanted consistency across the board with their naturals and honeys this year. Using yeast, was the best way to ensure this.For this year's lot, ripe cherries were picked and put in a floatation tank as usual to remove immatures. The cherries that sank were then put in airtight food grade barrels and a yeast culture was added. Fermentation was carefully monitored and after 64 hours the coffee was put out to dry slowly  on raised beds in a polyhouse(the new normal  thanks to unseasonal harvest rains).All this care has resulted in a coffee that is fruity but also clean and insanely sweet. We find the acidity very raspberry like and the sweetness reminds us of vanilla. We cannot state enough about how sweet and drinkable this year's iteration of mind=blown is. The coffee is very versatile and is a delight across all brews, manual (degassing time 3 days) and espresso (degassing time 14 days)."

Coffee cherries have been picked ripe and slow-dried on raised beds.The resulting coffee is a curious concoction in the cup, being brighter than other naturals that we have cupped.
