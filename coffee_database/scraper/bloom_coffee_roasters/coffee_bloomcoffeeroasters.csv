variety: catuai
processing: red honey
roast: light
producers: mr pavan nanjappa
tasting notes: mango, hibiscus and butterscotch
we along with so many others have swooned for two seasons over the incredible yellow honey that pavan produces every year. this year, the team at the venkids valley estate decided to take their catuai a step further, from a yellow honey process to a red honey process and take our word for it, this is an exceptional coffee. with the new process, the coffee has become slightly sweeter with more intense flavours and a richer mouthfeel.
we have roasted this pretty lightly to let the coffee, and the process really shine through and take the centre stage. with sweet notes of mango, rich butterscotch and delicate hints of hibiscus this coffee makes an incredible filter coffee that we're sure you'll absolutely enjoy!"

elevation: 4920 ft.
variety: chandragiri and sl9
processing: washed
roast: medium
tasting notes: citrus fruits, cherries, and nuts
originating from one of the highest growing regions in tamil nadu, these coffees are dense and have a beautiful aftertaste because of the high growing region. the laks farm is completely organic and devoid of any chemical pesticides and fertilisers. the coffees are intercropped with oranges, cardamom, pepper and banana. the beans of the highest brix are identified (colour coded bands are given to workers at the estate to pick the cherries). they are sorted for defects twice before using the penagos washer + pulper. floats are removed and the coffee beans with little bit of mucilage are dried on raised beds. they are exposed to the morning sun for the first two days and then completely dried in shade for a period of 20-25 days.
mr. iyer is without doubt one of the sweetest and most earnest people we have encountered in coffee and with passion and efforts of viggnesh in processing, this coffee was one of the best washed coffees we tasted this year! this medium roast has sweet notes of cherry, and nuts with a mild citrus acidity, and works really well both black and with milk, as a filter or an an espresso! "

a short, scenic drive from madikeri, past a rivulet or two, leads you to the charming “papakuchi coffee” by venkids valley estate, where you are welcomed by pavan and his wife shilpa. the estate spreads across 200 acres, and is divided into “patte” or fields, named aptly by the workers. imagine being able to spot the exact patch of land your coffee was grown on. yes, that’s the level of traceability pavan is able to achieve at this estate.
this sln6, grown in the “kenjipatte” is roasted to slightly darker than a medium (some might even call it a medium) to really enhance the syrupy body and the notes of caramel which are offset by the a splash of orange zest. pretty great for filters, great for espresso!
pick you grind and brew away!"

the origin of this blend goes a fair way back to when pavan (venkids valley estate) and navin (moganad estate) were schoolmates and were busy making plans for the world domination of indian speciality coffee! little did they know then, that the catalyst for this would be small roastery out of chandigarh, of all the places who would put their two phenomenal washed arabicas together in a top secret ratio, name it after the one of the greatest painters of all time, which is also a word play on their names, and make it the most the delicious, versatile blend to have ever come out of the greater chandigarh region! pavan and navin still remain very tight, and share flights, coffees, jokes, and the roasters they choose to work with! thankfully, they both agreed to partner with us, which in turn enabled us to come up with this super tasty, bright like a red vineyard, over the cafe terrace at night, lit up by the starry night
all stories aside our vin van gogh is our answer to a coffee blend that does everything very very well! it makes a great fruity filter coffee, as well the perfect espresso to have as it is, or a lovely fluffy cappuccino! pick the grind of your choice, and bask in the glory of vin’s and van’s artistry!"

this blend features the lovely washed arabica from the moganad estate, and the natural processed robusta from the venkids valley estate. but beware, if you’re expecting a bitter, boring blend, this will let you down! ro-busta rhymes is a super duper tasty blend that really brings the best out both species of the coffees, but what’s really interesting is that acidity and the sweetness in this blend comes a great deal from the robusta! we recommend you try this blend black just to really get a feel of what the robusta brings to it!"

chocolate, dark caramel and hints of citrus, sounds to us like one of the magnificent trumpet solos of the one the only louis armstrong! for us, louis armstrong a.k.a. satchmo is the epitome of balance, with a voice that can go from a deep, rich gravel to almost fragile falsettos. every moment of every song is filled with gorgeous melody, depth and genius improvisations!
“satchmo” the blend, just like it’s muse, has pitch perfect sweetness, a deep body that swells like a crescendo, and a subtle “vibratoesque” citrus acidity. a coffee that goes not toe to toe, but “cheek to cheek” with all accompaniments. the blend is on the darker side of a medium, and has the richness of chocolate and dark caramel, and a raspy acidity that can cut through whatever you throw at it, yes we’re looking at you milk and sugar. satchmo makes the perfect espressos, moka pots, french presses, south indian filters, and what not, to get you a coffee that’ll make you see sit across and think “what a wonderful world”"

over the last 3 years, we have received some delicious excellent coffees from the wonderful people at balanoor plantations. they have been producing some of the finest speciality coffee in the country for a number of years, and they have undoubtedly given us some of our favourite washed coffees. the kents variety is found widely in indian coffee, and the work that the team at balanoor puts in really makes this delightful coffee. this is the third year we've had this coffee, and somehow despite all the challenges, it just keeps getting better!

tasting notes: caramel, bakers chocolate, berries and vanilla
meera - a fearless espresso blend that breaks the conventions of what an espresso blend should be! meera is our medium-light roast espresso blend with notes of strawberries, baker’s chocolate, vanilla and decadent caramel. this is our tribute to one of india's most celebrated mystic poets, meera bai. 
meera features two incredible coffees, our staple washed arabica from coorg’s favourite plantation, the venkids valley estate, and a stunning “natural naturals“ from the krishnagiri estate, located in some of the highest elevations of chikmagalur. what do we get when we blend a clean bright washed and a super sweet, jammy natural naturals? a yummy, sweet, super complex, rich espresso, which holds its own in milk beverages as well!
it’s fair to say that this blend has had a pretty long development phase, but you know that we don’t take our blends lightly, and launch them only when we’re really happy with it, and right now we’re delighted with this and are finally ready to introduce you to “meera”.
recommended recipe:
dose: being a lighter roast, we would recommend dosing one-half a gram lesser than what you would dose for a medium/medium dark roast coffee
grind size: grind a step or two finer than what you would normally for a medium roast
yield: we recommend a yield of 2.5 times the dose of the dry coffee. for eg: dose: 20 grams; yield: 50 grams
time: the lighter the roast, the more you need to extract to get good sweetness and complexity. we like shots between 28-33 seconds for a straight 9-bar approach for meera. if you can pressure profile, we like to start with a 5-second pre-infusion at 2 bars, and then ramp up to 8 bars till we hit the desired yield, which usually takes around 45-50 seconds.
puck prep: we can't over-emphasise how important the puck prep is for a coffee like this. make sure, you dose correctly and evenly, wdt is highly recommended here, tamp as evenly as you can and clean around the edges of the portafilter. this will minimise channelling and give you a more even extraction.

sreeraksha is one of those planters without whom most coffee businesses will fail. he understands and supports, ensuring mutual success, not only does he produce incredible coffee, but he is also a fantastic person.
the baarbara estate burundi washed is one of the most pleasant coffees we tasted this year, with its complex dual fermentation (dry and wet) and superbly focussed sorting and meticulous picking. this coffee is 'simply' a delight. the roast profile is medium-light; here, the longer development helps caramelise the sugars and make them easily soluble in the coffee. the complex fermentation brings out the flavours of red grapes, with the sweet acidity of sweet lime and a delicious hazelnutty aftertaste, making it a crowd-pleaser.
this medium-light roast does well in both filter and espresso brews, and makes some smashing milk beverages."

variety: sachimore
processing: washed
fermentation: in fruit fermentation before pulping
roast: medium-light
producers: hoysala coffee
tasting notes: coffee blossom, stone fruit, & oranges
the hoysala estate was started in the late 1800s is has been family-owned since the 1950's. this washed process lot comes from their farm located in angadi village near chikmagalur where the hoysala dynasty started in the 9th century. sunil & mohan and their families have taken hoysala coffee to similar heights through their incredible knowledge and expertise in growing, and processing coffee. working with them for the first time during this harvest, and trying some of their coffees really blew us away.
like other coffees at their farm, this washed coffee is grown using regenerative farming practices, and no chemical fertilisers. this fermented-washed sachimore was one of our favourite washed coffees from the previous year's harvest and features a delicate floral note reminiscent of coffee blossom. with a medium-light roast, the coffee has developed a lovely stone fruit sweetness and a subtle orange acidity.
this coffee works superbly as a filter and as an espresso, and pairs very well with small milk beverages like a cortado or macchiato. we hope you love this one as much as we have!"

variety: catuai
processing: washed
fermentation: 30 hours anaerobic fermentation
roast: light
producers: mr. ashok patre
tasting notes: malta, coffee blossom and cherries
this washed cautai is one of the cleanest and brightest coffees we tasted this year. the cherries underwent a 30-hour in-fruit anaerobic fermentation and were then pulped and washed, and slowly dried for 20 days on raised beds. the anaerobic fermentation along with an immaculate washing process, has created a phenomenal layer of complexity while retaining the coffee's true flavour profile. 
catuai as a variety is making a resurgence the world over, and farms like ratnagiri are leading the way for it in india. with meticulous farming methods and advanced processing techniques, indian catuais are becoming some of the coveted coffees. with this washed coffee, we feel that the variety really shines through in the cup. 
for washed coffees, we like to focus on creating a clean but elegant cup through our roast profile. with a quick drying and longer maillard, we were able to retain its floral notes and its citrus acidity while creating a sweet and lingering finish and structure. this coffee is perhaps best enjoyed as a filter, but who’s stopping you from making incredible espressos from this?"
