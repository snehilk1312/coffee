https://kcroasters.com/products/best-medium-roast-coffee,Red Honey By Kelagur Estate | Medium Roast Coffee,"T he name comes from this coffee’s cherries and the way the coffee bean is processed. Coffee cherries are picked when they’re fully red in colour (separating them from the yellow, unripe cherries). The cherries are then washed and each coffee bean is shade processed. Shade processing slows down the drying time, resulting in higher fermentation of the beans giving this coffee a sweeter taste (almost like adding a drop of honey) making it one of our best medium roast coffees. Region : Chikmaglur, Karnataka Process : Honey Sun-dried Altitude : 3500 Feet Best with : Moka Pot, Pour Over, French Press, Espresso, Electric Brewer Cupper's Notes: Red Apple, Sweet Spices, & Jaggery Note - We highly recommend trying Red Honey, as an espresso coffee or an French Press. - All our coffees are packed in bio-degradable packs and shipped within 24 hours of roasting.","chikmaglur,karnataka",honey sun-dried,3500 feet,"moka pot,pour over,french press,espresso,electric brewercupper&#39;s","red apple,sweet spices,&amp;jaggery",'750'

After the immense love that we received for Sheild What's In The Name? Reptilian by name, reptilian at first sight - but actually a fish. Snakeheads are the most common and dominant group of air-breathing freshwater fish in India - and ones that have piqued our communal ecological interests. In the coffee yard, we took it up a notch this season with this naturally processed coffee - using our spring water - the habitat for Kerehaklu’s Snakeheads. We can honestly say that these are the best coffees ever produced - and only apt to name it after the ‘murrel’ as we call it in Kannada. The snakehead is an indigenous fish to India which are present in these very spring water-fed lakes within Kerehaklu - giving it its name Why The '10' In The Name? The 10 in the name actually refers to the Selection 10 varietal that we have chosen exclusively for you all. This lot is a carefully processed Selection 10 from the Nandi Block of Kerehaklu. The plants are intercropped with citrus, below a canopy of fig trees. The Snakehead Natural Process was undertaken where the fruits were first harvested selectively from the bushes and a ripe-only approach. These were then brought back, rinsed thoroughly with floats removed. Following that, the fruits fermented in whole-fruit but under spring water and within barrels - with certain parameters regularly checked. These were then dried on raised beds for ten days with regular raking and sorting.
