This year's Phenom promises an extraordinary experience as we proudly announce our partnership with Mooley Manay Estate , situated near the beautiful backwaters of the Harangi Reservoir in Coorg, Karnataka. Producers Komal and Akshay Dashrath have masterfully embraced a data-driven approach to farming and coffee processing. Their unwavering belief in the pivotal role of data in optimizing agricultural techniques and ensuring the utmost quality in coffee production is truly inspiring. This coffee is a 64 Hours Yeast Inoculated-Natural. The process begins with hand-picking ripe coffee cherries and floating them in water. Ripe, denser cherries sink, while unripe or damaged ones float and are removed. The coffee is then placed in sealed tanks for a controlled, anaerobic fermentation lasting 64 hours, during which a custom yeast culture is introduced to the coffee. After fermentation, the coffee is transferred to a polyhouse and spread on raised drying beds. It is regularly raked to ensure even drying, which continues until the coffee reaches a specific moisture level (around 12 - 11%). Once dry, the coffee is bagged and stored for 2 months before further processing.

To bring out the best in every batch, we introduce Jesse Pinkman, aka trader Mr. Baninder Kochar, whose skill in profile roasting adds a unique touch to our coffee. Together, they ensure every cup you brew will be an exceptional experience that exceeds all expectations. This coffee continues our love for Natural processed coffees because of its complexity in both flavor and its aromatic notes. The ripened cherries are hand-picked and triple-washed to remove all the floaters from the cherries. They are then processed in purpose-built tanks where CO2 is introduced to flush out the oxygen from the tanks to ferment the cherries for longer. The second stage of fermentation is introducing yeast along with various fruits such as Pineapple , Peach , Red Fruit , Watermelon , and grapes for 14 days when the fermentation happens slowly. The yeast thrives in the low oxygen environment and helps develop complex fruit notes. Once the fermentation is complete, cherries are slowly dried on raised beds to remove excess water and improve air circulation for even drying. This process is complex and delicate. It took 4 years of research with the wine industry for the Heisenberg of the Indian Coffee Industry to get the right level of flavor. With the aroma of figs,  this coffee is a fruit party with tasting notes of Fig, Cranberry, Roasted Pineapple, and Port Wine. Experience the special formula that Heisenberg has implemented this time.

A particular yeast strain was added to the coffee in the fermenters and allowed to ferment for 76 hours in a Carbon Dioxide-rich environment. After reaching the desired Ph value the coffee is subjected to a rapid heating process to a particular temperature and then allowed to remain for 10 minutes. Immediately after that, the coffee is cooled rapidly using chilled water. This process of Thermal Shock induces extremely complex flavours.
