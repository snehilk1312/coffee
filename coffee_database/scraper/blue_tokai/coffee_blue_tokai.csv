Our latest offering is a bright and sharp light roast, processed using the CIMA Yeast. Ripe coffee cherries are handpicked and washed in a water stream that courses through the estate. After careful sorting, the cherries are mixed and fermented for 72 hours using the CIMA yeast which enhances their fruity notes while preserving their delicate character. Finally, the cherries are dried on raised beds for a minimum of 20 days until they reach the perfect moisture content. The result is a beautifully vibrant coffee with notes of stewed apple, chamomile, jackfruit, and pomegranate. The aroma invites you in with whispers of berries and dried fruits, while a delightful fruity finish lingers on the palate. As Sreeraksha, one of the producers who envisioned and nurtured this lot, puts it, “This year, we wanted a different flavour profile, so we tried the CIMA yeast. It lowered the intensity but increased the sharpness of the flavours and this change helped us get a much brighter and sharper coffee”.",Producer Series,https://bluetokaicoffee.com/collections/roasted-and-ground-coffee-beans/products/baarbara-estate-cima
