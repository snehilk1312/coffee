https://kcroasters.com/products/best-medium-roast-coffee,Red Honey By Kelagur Estate | Medium Roast Coffee,"T he name comes from this coffee’s cherries and the way the coffee bean is processed. Coffee cherries are picked when they’re fully red in colour (separating them from the yellow, unripe cherries). The cherries are then washed and each coffee bean is shade processed. Shade processing slows down the drying time, resulting in higher fermentation of the beans giving this coffee a sweeter taste (almost like adding a drop of honey) making it one of our best medium roast coffees.
