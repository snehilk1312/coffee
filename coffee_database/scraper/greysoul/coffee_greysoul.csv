Roast Profile 202-3°C Drop with 15% DTR & overall roast time of 9 mins. Minimum resting period Filter 7 Days A song that pairs well Suitable for filter brewing methods. Roaster thoughts : Natural processed coffees rate higher on a BRIX meter due to its sugar content and also have a higher moisture percentage comparatively. Slow roasting these LOTS with a lower drum speed and lighter roasts brings out the best. To achieve its full potential we followed a approach of roasting this coffee for a minimum of 8.30 mins with a extended maillard phase. We took about 12 samples out between 8.30 and 10.30 minutes with variable drum speeds by roasting 2 separate batches and then cupped the coffees. No to our surprise the light profiles were very flavorful, had bright acidity in them and overall balanced. These exceptional LOTS are now yours to brew with, experience and enjoy the final cup. Know the Region: Zunheboto is situated in the heart of Nagaland at the height of 1900 meters above sea level and known for its natural beauty and the home of the Sumi tribe. They have a hard working culture that acumulates with the harvest festival called “Tuluni” where they celebrate the fruit of their hard work with their rich culturral heritage, tradition with songs, colourful dance and the exchange of gifts."

Roaster thoughts : A special culture which is a mix of yeast and bacteria can result in scorching very easily. We had to roast this coffee at low temperature and  feed at an ever lower temperature. But this could easily compromise the flavours in final cup. Instead we took a different approach that resulted in the prominent notes overpowering the whole cupping room and the aroma was just intoxicating. This roast is one of our top 5 experimental profiles that has led to a very unique coffee. Enjoy its aroma, unique never had before flavours and juicy mouthfeel all at once. The estate and efforts: We all are familiar with the producer Mr. Ashok Patre and his family run estate Ratnagiri Estate. Our founder visited the farm back in the month of march 2021 when coffee processing was at its peak. A day's visit to the estate to understand the farm, the processing techniques and the history behind the legacy was great. Our meeting began with knowing each other and talking and about the passion that runs Grey Soul Coffee as a brand. Then it led to discussions about the specialty community and culture in our country right now. Moving on, we spoke about cup score, Q grading and how it varies from person to person and hence become highly subjective. Then we spoke about international markets and a comparison between Indian and south American coffee. Then quickly moved on a long elaborate your of the farm where some coffee was milled and ready, some drying on raised beds, some drying out in the fields and hand garbling in works as final sorting was in process. In the end, specialty coffee can be simply defined as the coffee that is of the best quality without comprises. This is exactly what this estate stands for and believes in."

Roasting a lot like this also requires careful disbursement of heat with low drum temperatures. We roasted this coffee at a fairly lower drum speed with lower initial heat that gradually rises and reduces before the first crack to end the roast at a light-medium level with a drop temperature of 205 Degree. Produces a med-heavy bodied, fruity and enjoyable final cup. About the Process: Ripe cherries were selected, floaters were removed and inoculated in barrels with Intenso yeast. The fermentation was done in a cool shaded area for 48 hrs during which we constantly monitored the temperature as well as PH never allowing it to drop below 4. Post that coffee was removed and put on trays and kept under shade nets for drying.

Roaster thoughts : A varietal that we only roasted once in the past during sampling of previous harvest year. As it is hybrid with one part costa rican it derives inherit qualities such as the final cup being clean with moderate acidity levels. Taking that into consideration we have roasted this coffee to a medium roast to produce a much sweeter final cup. Dropped at 208 degrees this is a ideal medium roast that is heavier on the body with balanced acidity. Also called the Indian Geisha: It's a late maturing vigorous variety with elongated berries with very sweet pulp ideal for naturals. These ripe purple cherries are handpicked sorted passed through the flotation tank to remove floaters. The cherries with a brix content above 22 were anaerobically fermented in barrels for 60 hrs under cool conditions with constant monitoring of the pH. The cherries were then put on trays and dried under shade for 22 days with constant raking for even drying.

Often while roasting there are high chances of charring the bean leading to uneven roast. Keeping that in mind we have roasted this lot at a low drum speed and careful heat transfer. This particular Lot was first profiled by us on a sample roaster bullet and then again sample roasted on a probat too. Collected samples were then cupped to confirm that the replication was achieved. Post that 6 more sample roasts were done before we cupped them all and finalized a profile that shined through. About the Process: Ripe purple cherries with a brix of 22 and above were selected, floats were removed and the washed cherries were inoculated with lalcafe Cima yeast  in barrels the barrels were sealed airtight. The anaerobic fermentation was done in a cool shaded area for 72 hrs during which we constantly monitored the temperature as well as PH never allowing it to drop below 4. After 72 hrs the cherries are removed and put on trays  and kept under shade nets for drying . The entire drying process takes between 17-22 days.

The farm previously produced only commercial grade coffees, but with a new approach to quality it recently started producing higher grade coffees and experimental lots. Now recently converted to 100% specialty coffees and also won the Gold award at the Aurora International Taste Challenge. This had put a lot of pressure on us as roasters but at the same time we felt lucky to be in possession of these lots. The approach we took was to roast was between first crack to second crack. Another approach was to roast between first crack to 10% DTR. Post resting, cupping and brewing we found a ideal light roast to be a favorable final cup. Know the Region: Kohima, is the capital of the Northeastern Indian state of Nagaland. With a resident population of almost 100,000, it is the second largest city in the state.

This espresso roast profile is ideal to have as an espresso, ristretto, americano, cortado and cappuccino's. A different approach to roasting is what we adapted to this lot and is what we call extended maillard technique. In this particular way, we start off the roast at a lower temperature and gradually increase post the dry end phase which allows the coffee to roast longer during the browning phase thus producing the sweet acidity, denser crema and long lasting finish.

Roaster thoughts : A rare varietal and a unique coffee process is what we roasters at Grey Soul Coffee Roasters look forward to. It was not easy and never will be to roast such meticulously roasted coffees, but the outcome is certainly something to look forward to. Well to be honest we sample roasted the coffees the results were outstanding while roasting and cupping. When we moved on to the production LPG roaster it did go haywire for our very first batch where the coffee was baked but not technically charred as we lost control post caramelization stage. As we got a better grip and post make adjustments to the roast profile we got we needed to achieve and that a very well balanced light-medium roast dropped at 205. The estate and efforts: We all are familiar with the producer Mr. Ashok Patre and his family run estate Ratnagiri Estate. Our founder visited the farm back in the month of march 2021 when coffee processing was at its peak. A day's visit to the estate to understand the farm, the processing techniques and the history behind the legacy was great. Our meeting began with knowing each other and talking and about the passion that runs Grey Soul Coffee as a brand. Then it led to discussions about the specialty community and culture in our country right now. Moving on, we spoke about cup score, Q grading and how it varies from person to person and hence become highly subjective. Then we spoke about international markets and a comparison between Indian and south American coffee. Then quickly moved on a long elaborate your of the farm where some coffee was milled and ready, some drying on raised beds, some drying out in the fields and hand garbling in works as final sorting was in process. In the end, specialty coffee can be simply defined as the coffee that is of the best quality without comprises. This is exactly what this estate stands for and believes in."

We roasted this coffee several ways starting from 200 all the way ranging to 209 to achieve DTR of 15%. At every stage the coffee tasted unique while we cupped it. The bright orange color at 200 Degrees, the balance of flavors at 203, the texture and body at 207 and finally at 209 the incredible complexity it brought through. Eventually after the drum speed variations, burner highs and lows and control over exhaust temperature the 203 DROP was selected by our cuppers and roasters as it brought in the rich sweetness, incredible aroma and tropical fruit characteristics along with a heavy body.

A song that pairs well Roaster thoughts : Roasting a coffee at light medium with a desired DTR is never an easy outcome to achieve. When planning this roast we were quite cautious of the DROP temperature because it is essential to have a perfect roast. A roast lower can render the coffee slightly under or a degree up can make it a medium roast which makes it loose its essence. Also of course, before finalizing the roast we did cup the coffee at different levels, but it was different this time. This is time the difference between batches was marginal, as there was less room to play when it came to heat, but we created more parameters with starting temperatures. Overall, it was a great experience and we are quite pleased with the outcome. The release of aroma when hot water comes in contact with coffee is dense and fruity. When the crust is broken into, there is a release citrus fruit like aroma. The taste resembles bright green grapes with a sweet white tea finish and pleasant lingering sweetness. Total roast time of 9.26 seconds with 10-12% DTR.

Roaster thoughts : Roasting specialty coffee this year is a worldly experience altogether. Coffee processing in our country this year has taken a leap. This particular LOT is a AAA Grade coffee coming from Ratnagiri Estate and a single farmer LOT. It is a washed process coffee. We roasted this coffee 5 ways right from 205 ° all the way upto to 212 ° . After speaking with the producer, understanding the coffee and processing, we knew a lighter roast wont produce the right balance of flavors and a roast level of medium or a medium-dark was needed. After successfully cupping trials of found a 210 ° drop to the ideal roast profile for this LOT. About the Estate : Ratnagiri International is a proud estate located in the Baba Budangiri Hills of Chikmagalur. It is renowned in our country and also beyond our geographical borders for its focus, vision and dedication to coffee processing. LOTS produced by this estate have been consistently scoring high and have always surpassed its pre-cursors."
