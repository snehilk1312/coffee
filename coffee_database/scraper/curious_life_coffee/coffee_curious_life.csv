"Gachatha AA Filter, KENYA",₹ 2200,https://curiouslifecoffee.com/product/gachatha-aa-kenya-filter-copy/,"SL 28, 34, Ruiru & Baitan",Double Washed,Kenya,"Nyeri, Central Province",5900- 6800 ft,Several small holder farmers,Filter,"One of our most loved Kenyan, Gachatha AA is back. Loaded with intense fruitiness and vibrant acidity, Gachatha is a delight in cup. You shall enjoy floral and sweet aromatics with notes of black currants, ripe fruits and cane juice. So, for all the happy reminiscences, from Kenya we have had, Konyu, Kiambara, Gachatha, Karatina and again Gachatha :). Gachatha has been so consistently good that we shall try and make it a permanent feature, but then every good roaster across the continents digs for this one, let’s hope we stay lucky. These are couple of batches of trial roasts and already tasting so good. Shall come up with final roast soon after few more tweaks to perfect it. About The Farm Gachatha Coffee Factory rests on a 392-acre piece of land between the villages of Muthuaini, Thiriku, Gachenge, and Kianjau. It started in 1963 to form the Gachatha Farmers’ Co-operative Society Ltd. Co-op. Its current stands at 1,542. The area surrounding Gachatha area is densely populated, so every effort is made to minimize impact. The factory treats all water in soak pits to ensure no contaminates run into the local waterways, which are a source for drinking water. The community also places great importance on protecting the indigenous trees that remain in the area, so that the local bird life can be sustained. LOCATION Gachatha factory was formed in 1963 and it is situated in the slopes of the Aberdare mountain range, Karundu location, Nyeri County about 150km north of Kenya’s capital Nairobi. SOILS AND CLIMATE Gachatha Coffee Factory experiences moderate bimodal rainfall and temperatures here range from 13 to 24C year round. The main varieties of coffee grown here is SL28, Batian, SL34 and Ruiru 11. The region has deep, fertile well drained red volcanic soils which are ideal for coffee production. PROCESSING After picking, ripe cherry is brought to the factory by smallholder farmers, before it undergoes processing to remove the skin and pulp – known as the wet processing method. The nearest water source and the factory are dependent on electrical pumps to move water to reservoir tanks before using it for processing. Water is also recirculated for conservation. The factory is using a disc pulper with three sets of discs to remove the skin and fruit from the inner parchment layer that is protecting the green coffee bean. After pulping, the coffee is fermented overnight to break down the sugars, before it is cleaned, soaked and spread out on raised drying tables. Time on the drying tables depends on climate, ambient temperature and total production volumes currently undergoing processing. MILLING PROCESS Hulling machinery removes the parchment layer (endocarp) from wet processed coffee. Hulling dry processed coffee refers to removing the entire dried husk — the exocarp, mesocarp and endocarp — of the dried cherries. Polishing is an optional process where any silver skin that remains on the beans after hulling is removed by machine. While polished beans are considered superior to unpolished ones, in reality, there is little difference between the two. Grading and Sorting is done by size and weight, and beans are also reviewed for color flaws or other imperfections. Beans are sized by being passed through a series of screens. They are also sorted pneumatically by using an air jet to separate heavy from light beans. Finally, defective beans are removed either by hand or by machinery. Beans that are unsatisfactory due to deficiencies (unacceptable size or color, over-fermented beans, insect-damaged, unhulled) are removed. SUSTAINABLE FARMING In line with the rising awareness on the need to conserve the environment, the factory has dug the waste water soak pits away from the water source where the waste water is allowed to soak in back to the soil. Currently the factory does not engage in waste water treatment. Additionally the society encourages its members to plant trees on their farms. MANAGEMENT Gachatha Coffee factory is run by a factory manager who oversees all activities within the factory. Together with other staff members they carry out duties such as weighing coffee, selection and grading of coffee, paying farmers and addressing farmers’ complaints."
"Shyira, RWANDA – Filter",₹ 1590,https://curiouslifecoffee.com/product/__trashed-4__trashed/,Red Bourbon,Washed,Rwanda,Nyabihu,5200- 5700 ft,,Filter,"About the Farm Since 2016, this Red Bourbon from Rwanda has been a regular on shelves. Located in Nyabihu District in North Western Region of Rwanda, Shyira washing station is managed by Josue Dusengiyumva. This is MTCo.’s smallest washing station and sources coffee from the highest altitudes (1800 – 2200 MASL) out of their 5 stations, which explain its uniqueness amongst the rest of the produce. Shyira only has 1 full time staff and 42 casual workers during peak season. Shyira is an hour drive up the hills from the township of Musanze (Ruhengeri). The weather conditions, soil type and its high-altitude lands makes this CWS an ideal setting for high-quality coffee processing and production. On the drive up to the CWS, when you reach on top of the Shyira hills, you will be met with a view that will take your breath away – the chain of volcanoes in between the beautiful beasts of Rwanda the Mountain Gorillas come from to the waterfalls of the wonderful Gicice river. As if that is not enough, combined with the valley full of white sands, fog covering hills and good weather makes Shyira truly unique and one of a kind. The station is located deep high in the ranges of the iconic and world-renowned Virunga Mountain and National park ranges. This is where the Mountain Gorillas/Silverbacks are from; perhaps the best-known wildlife in Rwanda where a lady primatologist named Dian Fossey gave away her life saving these mountain gorillas. The high altitude, plentiful rain and highly fertile and nutritional soils in the area are the reasons why it produces some truly phenomenal tasting coffees. Shyira CWS only produced fully Washed coffees this season and all was of the Red Bourbon Varietal. The fermentation period was 12 hours and took average of 35 days of sun drying on the African drying beds. Enjoy !!"

Young Saif Ulla, who curates this estate is a master of management degree holder from Leeds Beckett University. Though he was working with Tesco in Leeds but his heart was always back home with coffee plantations. In 2015 he decided to moved back and take care of Gundikhan Estate. He totally transformed the farm beginning with removing old plants and planting new one with focus on Chandragiri varietal, a development by coffee board of India on Sarchimore, a cross between Villa Sarchi (a bourbon mutation) and Timor varieties. His commitment to modern and environment friendly practises focused on cup flavour with a sustainable yield has transformed the Gundikhan Estate. Today this estate takes pride in growing some of the finest coffees in India. Gundikhan Estate is blessed with mineral rich soil with high iron content and the microclimate assisted by neighbouring Bhadra Tiger Reserve has been a boon. Saif ensures that all his practices are sustainable and are in sync with the nature around. Other than coffee you can find groves of 11 different tropical fruits and spices in this estate and that further enriches the ecosystem. Meticulous picking, controlled fermentation and washing/ processing practises with constantly monitored raised bed drying ensures that these coffees shine above other coffees of the region. We cupped some brilliant washed coffees as well from this estate, unfortunately none were available and we could just manage around 40-50 kg. However, we assure you of some great washed coffee from this farm during the coming harvest, Gundikhan is here to stay with Curious Life."
"Shyira, RWANDA – Espresso",₹ 1590,https://curiouslifecoffee.com/product/rwanda-shyira-espresso/,Red Bourbon,Washed,Rwanda,Nyabihu,5200 – 5700 feet,,Espresso,"In the cup This medium roast is the most balanced single origin espresso we have ever come across. It begins with a syrupy sweetness of blackberry and sugarcane leading to richer chocolate notes. Body is rich with honey like texture. Finish is sweet with more of chocolate flavours lingering for long. Recommended for you if you like slightly more developed darker roasts with or without milk. Roasted almond notes are highlighted with milk. Straight espressos are better with a ratio of 1:2.5 Milk beverage with espresso are best if you add milk only upto two times the weight of an espresso; a 40g espresso should be topped with 80g of steamed whole milk to get the right balance of flavours. Enjoy on Moka Pot/ Conical Filter / AeroPress as black or with a dash of milk. Not recommended for cold brew, this method can strangulate the vibrancy of this coffee as this method renders to an undesirable baggy/ nutty note. If you like it cold, brew it hot and leave it in refrigerator to chill in a container with minimum head space."
