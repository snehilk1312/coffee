You see, the text suggests that both Arabica and Robusta have their own unique qualities and advantages. While Arabica is known for its complexity in sweetness and flavor, Robusta is more robust and bold.\n",

Specialty coffee roasters often prioritize quality over quantity, which means they are willing to pay a premium for high-quality beans with unique flavor profiles. In this case, Black Baza's higher prices for Robusta may be due to their focus on delivering exceptional taste and quality, rather than simply choosing one type of coffee bean over the other.\n",
