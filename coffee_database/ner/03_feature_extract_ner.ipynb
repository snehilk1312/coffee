    "Jasmine kissed cranberry - 100 % arabica that is sourced from Chikmagalur, grown at an altitude of approximately 4,100ft to 4,500ft. It gets its unique name through a process which include a strain of yeast used to create a carbon dioxide-rich environment during fermentation in stainless-steel fermenters. A remarkable level of complexity in the beans is created by this process, laying the groundwork for a wonderful cup of coffee. Steady drying on raised beds is the next important step, which lets the flavors gradually develop and intensify. After another 30 days of continuous stirring, the coffee undergo additional drying developing scent of jasmine, complex notes of raspberries, cranberries, and sparkling malic acidity with a lingering floral aftertaste \n",
