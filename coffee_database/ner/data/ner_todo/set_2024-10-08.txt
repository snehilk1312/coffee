farmer ' s filter coffee farmer ' s original filter coffee : we always wanted to have a blend developed in - house with balanced/unique flavor notes . after continuous experiments and cupping for two years we believe this variant is ready for launch . ' rich taste ' would generally result in milder cup of coffee compromising strength . if strength is given preference flavor notes are compromised and bitter notes would be predominant flavor . we wanted to create a blend to our customers which is rich in taste but strength intact ( also bitter notes suppressed ) . after continuous experiments we realized just blending process in any ratio would not give desired output . we developed in - house processing technique and subjected coffee to special fermentation technique to have sweeter notes . but we also needed slight bitter notes for strength . hence robusta beans were chosen over arabica . aa graded large beans used consistency . medium plus roast profile was selected . ground coffee blended with chicory . its our favorite filter coffee . farmer ' s filter coffee
